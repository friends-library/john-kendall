== EXTRACTS from LETTERS OF RICHARD SHACKLETON. 

11th month 1755.

It looks as if we must labour hard for our bread through the course of the meetings.
Perhaps it may be best so, for what is hardly gotten is oftentimes carefully kept.
And indeed,
I think I have seen great loss accrue to some of honourable rank in this respect,
that when good Providence, in unmerited condescension,
has favoured them with the bedewings of his goodness,
in order for leavening and seasoning their spirits
for his service which is so much wanting,
they have, for want of knowing a settlement and abiding in the life,
let these favours pass transiently over,
and not be productive of the fruits intended by them.
And with sorrow it may be too often said of them, "`Their goodness is as a morning cloud,
and as the early dew it goeth away.`"

5th month 1769.

It is true my present situation is among the pots: yet I am a prisoner of hope.
I am indeed an impotent man; nor is there in me, nor in the powers of my nature,
any capacity to crawl near the salutary waters; much less to impart of them to others.
I can say of a truth, I am glad too see my equals, my familiar friends and acquaintance,
become my guides,
take the lead and grow from strength to strength in the great Master`'s cause.
It is my earnest desire that I may never injure it;
but having waded here through many deeps (unknown to mortals,)
I may be so preserved in my sorrowful pilgrimage,
as that I may at last lay down my weary head in peace,
and be admitted any where within the door of perpetual rest.

5th month 1770.

The several dispensations which we are under in our religious pilgrimage,
may be compared, I think, to the various turns, roads, and lanes in a journey.
I am at present, and have been for many years in one long lane;
when I shall get out of it, I know not.
The believer is not to make haste.
The great point is, to make strait steps, and keep steadily,
right on our way in the right road, without loitering, looking unnecessarily behind,
or in the impatience of our own spirits pressing too hastily forward.--Indeed,
I find the road of this life so bestrewed with difficulties and dangers,
and myself so exceedingly weak,
and unable by my own powers to preserve alive my own soul,
or even to succeed in my temporal transactions, by reason of my peculiar incapacity,
that under this sense I cannot but commit me and mine with great
earnestness to the protection and help of Divine Providence.

11th month 1770.

The warfare between the spirit which is not of the world, and the spirit which is of it,
is great and difficult: the situation of some makes it more so to them.
And the Being who is the source of all our happiness in time and eternity,
is a jealous Creator, demanding (as is his just right) the whole heart,
and will not accept of a partial sacrifice: he requires the prime, the best,
a whole burnt-offering.
May thou, my dear child,
steadily resign thyself in all humility to be guided in his wisdom,
so wilt thou be preserved an exceeding great comfort
to me thy poor inwardly-distressed father,
a blessing to the family, a way-mark, a good example,
and an ordinance of help to thy near and dear friends, whom thou lovest,
and by whom thou art beloved.
Thus, my beloved child, thou wilt be preserved out of the evils, which are in the world,
and the perplexities, perturbations and troubles consequent to them:
thou wilt grow from stature to stature in the experience of good;
and though in taking this cup of life, which is a cup of mixture,
thou may expect to meet with trouble,
yet thou will still find and feel the reward of thy diligence,
faithfulness and obedience, to be peace.

1st month 1773.

I have often compared myself to a reed shaken by the wind.
May thou dear child, be preserved in simplicity and nothingness of self, in humility,
and lowliness of mind.
Seeking diligently after and waiting steadily for the inward
experience of that which is unmixedly good.
This is the way to be helped along from day to day,
through one difficulty and proving after another, to the end of our wearisome pilgrimage,
having recourse, like the hunted hart, to the brook by the way,
when pressed by our spiritual enemies.
By this, my dear child, thy predecessors in our family, who lived in the truth,
were enabled to wade through their afflictions,
and know that overcoming which entitles to the glorious, eternal rewards.
Many are the favours which thou, my dear daughter,
hast received at the hand of the Great Giver.
What need I enumerate any of them?
thy grateful heart is sensible of them.
May thy branches, weighed down with humility, gratitude,
and all fruits of the spirit bend towards the root which sustains every tree of righteousness,
and from which its sap and life is supplied, and derived.
By humility and lowliness of mind, many temptations are avoided, and encumbrances escaped.
It is a safe and quiet habitation, into which the devil cannot enter,
and his emissaries view the dwelling with derision, and turn from it in contempt.
So the heavenly guest has more free admittance, and uninterrupted abode;
and the bread eaten in secret administers invisible, but effectual, support.

8th month 1773.

The meetings are large, and instrumental help afforded in them: but what shall I say?
a people professing the inward spiritual life and spiritual worship,
and holding the same forth to the world must be spiritually minded,
and dig deep down to the nether spring, the source,
the fresh supply of all right religious ability:
otherwise there will be a withering at the root, and decay at the heart;
although from the temporary showers which may fall from the clouds,
and the favourable aspect in which they are planted, there may be a fair semblance,
and enduring for a while.
My dear child, my spirit has often near unity with thee,
and I often and fervently desire thy stability in righteousness,
that thou may not cut and carve, and seek any thing for thyself,
nor seek to be any thing;
but when that which quickens and animates and refreshes a little is withdrawn,
then belike ashes, reduced to nothing, cold, inanimate as to religion.
So, patiently abiding in this low estate,
the Lord will give beauty for (or instead of those) ashes, the oil of joy for mourning,
and the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness.
My children are indeed near my heart;
and their steady wise walking in all humility along the perilous path of life,
as it will be their own great interest, so it would be my exceeding comfort;
for in this world they as well as I must meet with trouble.
This is not the place of rest and respite and safety, but the field of battle;
in which if we be foiled, there is no second place of combat;
we are ruined irretrievably.
But if by keeping close to the captain of our salvation,
and obeying his orders and directions, we happily obtain the victory,
the conquest is unspeakably glorious.

11th month 1773.

The business of the meeting is now over: the concluding meeting to be to-morrow.
This has been to me a particular day of dryness and insensibility.
I almost wonder at myself, how it is with me.
But we cannot always sacrifice.
We must learn to bear nakedness and famine, to be in prison and in deaths often.
Such is the state of us poor creatures while probationers here.
My dear children are often the subject of my prostrate petition,
that they may be preserved, by such means as Almighty Wisdom may appoint,
from the delusions of an insidious busy adversary,
that they may be entirely dedicated in body, soul and spirit to their great Creator,
and that he may graciously accept of them to be his
true and faithful servants in their generations.
This is what I wish and desire for my children:
not that they may be sons and daughters of the earth,
and have a name and fame among unregenerate men,
receiving their consolations whilst here,
and alienated and separated hereafter from blessed and refined spirits forever.

6th month 1777.

I Am in sentiment with thee that this trial may have been permitted for good purposes:
we may see thereby, and by numberless instances,
how uncertain is the state of human prosperity;
and how soon the fairest buildings of our imagination, our schemes and our hopes,
may be dashed to pieces.
We live in a world where, from a multitude of various causes,
we may be made most wretched and miserable, and miss of a place of rest hereafter.
What need have we then of walking awfully in humble thankfulness
when we enjoy all the necessaries and conveniences of life;
and when this life is rendered by our Almighty Benefactor not only tolerable but comfortable:
yea, when, in the infinity of his condescending goodness,
he is graciously pleased to superadd to his temporal
favours the visitations of his holy spirit,
to prepare us for, and afford us an earnest of eternal salvation.
May you, my dear children, keep your vessels (your hearts) clean, and empty,
waiting in abstractedness of thought and nothingness of self,
that those vessels may receive some of the blessed infusion,
which will preserve you sweet and savoury,
will strengthen you to go through the duties of this life with alacrity,
and qualify you to be of some service in the church in your day.
I have unity with you both in your baptisms, in your dedications,
and in your quickened resolutions, that you will choose the Lord and his service,
and not the world and its spirit, for the lot of your inheritance:
and the petition of my heart is for your growth and
establishment in the most precious truth.
Amen.

3rd month 1778.

We are short sighted, and of ourselves know not what is best for us,
or will in the end turn out most satisfactory to us, as to such matters.
One thing we may be assured of, that purity of heart,
and the cultivation of an intercourse between our
spirits and the author of all our blessings,
is our real, true, substantial, and permanent interest.
Uncertainty and disappointment are the natural growth of this country,
but unmixed enduring happiness is a plant of heaven: of the fruit of which tree,
my dear child, the saints on earth are at times permitted to feed;
and by this earnest are enabled to press through the difficulties of this life,
aspiring after the full fruition thereof in the life which is to come.

8th month 1778.

But we are grown such an outward instead of an inward people,
so carnal instead of spiritual, we lust so for words,
and for Moses (the servants) to speak, that some great revolution, some general calamity,
or at least some dreadful apprehension from the view of an uplifted rod,
seems not unlikely to be employed for our rousing and reformation.
My mind is at times much plunged in deep baptism under a sense of our degenerate state,
earnestly desirous that this most precious,
excellent and holy thing which was sent among mankind may prevail and spread,
and rule and reign, whose undoubted right it is.

9th month 1780.

I May therefore mention that our province meeting seemed to partake somewhat
of the poverty of the place and people where and among whom it was held.
Nevertheless, a degree of life attended,
and thy poor father was favoured with capacity to have access
to the place where prayer is wont to be made,
and there to offer his humble, earnest, lender petition for himself and others;
but almost a total imbecility for any active service in discipline attended me;
and I thought a reproof for my folly rather than any encouragement succeeded
a few words thrown out in the course of transacting some affairs of discipline,
which I hope to heap up to myself,
and hide in my heart for my better government another time: live and learn.
Thus is verified the proverb, The rod and reproof give wisdom,
but a child left to himself, bringeth his mother to shame.
The rebukes of the Divine Spirit correct and amend our spiritual defects,
and cultivate our spiritual understanding in enlargement of service;
but he that is left and deserted of that guide, and waits not for its direction,
but leans to his own understanding, is in danger of disgracing the cause,
which his ignorant zeal wants to promote,
and of bringing his mother (the church) to shame.

6th month 1781.

Yesterday I wasted in the world;
at my return home in the evening I got thy sweet memorial,
which was acceptable and comfortable;
Let us not be anxious about branching and spreading:
but take root downwards in the hidden life;
so shall we stand against the dangers which attend both from sun and wind;
from popular favour, and popular dislike.
I greatly love the littleness;
a grain of gold is of greater value than a deal of base metal.
Remember the bow, which hangs on the pin, unbent, till by command it is taken down,
and used; thus it preserves its force and elasticity.
May thy bow abide in strength, and the arms of thy hand be made strong.
I cannot express the love I have felt and feel for thee; again, keep low and humble,
and let self be of no reputation.
Those who covet the applause of men, and have an ear out for it, like listeners,
seldom hear good of themselves;
but those feel most of the inward strength and unity of the brethren,
who seek that honour which cometh from God only.

10th month 1781.

I Am obliged to thee for thy letter, for the openness and familiarity of it,
and for the friendship and freedom which it breathes.
I feel somewhat like a father, or rather a grandfather,
who likes very well to hear his child prattle to himself,
yet rebukes it when he fears it makes too free with another.
To branch out too diffusively in the epistolary way has a snare in it.
A multitude of correspondents is troublesome,
and there is a danger of there being more leaves than fruit.
We are variously appointed:
some perhaps may be allowed to indulge their inventive faculty,
and a vein of imagination, which others would be inwardly hurt by attempting.
Each of us should keep within the limits of our own tether.
We are each of us expressly told,
(as our first parents were) what is the fruit forbidden to us severally,
and death in a greater or lesser degree follows, if we touch it.
I believe some anointed servants have been hurt by suffering
their imaginations to wander upon unprofitable subjects,
as well as reading unprofitable books, and writing to an unprofitable degree.
A great deal depends on such keeping their vessels clean: there is a defilement,
which though it be not gross,
yet renders the vessel unfit for the reception of the heavenly virtue; or,
if it be infused, it loses of its fine quality, and is adulterated.
But, says the apostle, the will of God is, that ye should abstain from fornication,
and that every one of you should know how to possess
his vessel in sanctification and honour.
May it be thy care, my dear child, diligently to wait for the renewal of that baptism,
which keeps the vessel clean,
that so when the master of the house shall think fit to to take it off the shelf,
(where it may have been stood for some time,
with the mouth downward) it may be ready for immediate use.

2nd month 1782.

I Am not so solicitous about the permanence of our epistolary correspondence,
as I am about the permanence of pure love and real friendship between us.
Epistles, like testimonies and declarations, may cease, having had their day,
but fervent charity should abide undiminished.
When I was last in England,
I happened somewhere to hear that thou hadst a propensity to write much:
I thought there was a danger in it,
and I knew not how to act more consistently with that friendship which I felt and expressed,
than to warn thee of the danger.
I threw my then present thoughts together on the subject, and spread them before thee.
I know not how I expressed them,
but I know I did not mean thereby to preclude the freedom of an intercourse between us,
which may be limited and enlarged according to our best feelings.

I kept no copy of my letter; if any word or expression in it escaped me,
which was capable of giving thee offence,
I request thou wilt be so kind as to quote it with the context; and I shall I hope,
either explain to thy satisfaction or condemn it.
You speakers ought to be very ready to hear.
I have seen some very sensible seasonable reprehensions of thine,
which as they were well meant were also well taken.
Little cautionary hints often make up the most profitable,
though perhaps not the most pleasing part of a letter.
I thought it prettily expressed by Catharine Payton
long ago in a letter to a correspondent of hers;
"`I would not have thee think that I write this to please the natural part; no,
far be it from me to offer the incense of flattery,
or even pain my friends with a recital of their excellencies:
true friendship needs no such weak supports;
but is rather pleased with judicious reproofs.`"

As to my ever going again to your land, or any of my children,
it is quite a matter of uncertainty, enveloped in the cloud of futurity.
I have earnestly desired, and especially of late,
that I might not be suffered to go here and there lightly and foolishly;
but that divine wisdom might be graciously pleased to order my way and guide my steps.
I am blind and weak and ignorant, I think in a great degree;
and if merciful help does not interpose,
I am sure I shall be able neither to stand nor go.
Some of superior abilities and strength may trust in one thing or another; but as for me,
I have nothing to trust to for the preservation and welfare of me and mine,
but the mercy and condescending notice of the Lord Almighty.

12th month 1782.

I Remembered as I lay in bed that I was in debt to a long, instructive, affectionate,
obliging epistle of thine,
to which I have no sort of expectation of making any thing like an adequate return;
neither have I, that I know of, such emulation about me.
Honest friends, in entertaining one another, should not vie in elegance and superfluity,
but simply and cordially bring out the best they
happen to have in the house for their guests:
and though the fare may seem mean, yet if it be sound and savoury,
and served up by clean hands, there is no reason to be ashamed of it.
It is the affecting to appear something above our abilities that renders us contemptible,
and which if persisted in will be in danger of making us bankrupts.
But why these strictures?
They have no pointed meaning, my dear cousin; they are general observations.
I hope and believe we are both pretty clear of affectation, and superfluity,
and ostentation, though unintentionally I fell on this subject.
Love and unity, I trust, subsists between us;
and if admonition was necessary to be imparted,
I also trust we should receive it from each other
without having a recourse to any oblique insinuation.

They call our dwelling the Retreat.
It is indeed so in some respect; but annoyances of one sort or other will break in.
Flies are most troublesome in the shade.
To keep low and humble, to step cautiously and feelingly,
to watch diligently over the movements in our minds,
to wait for that baptising virtue which makes and preserves sweet and clean,
to be as good servants ready for every occasional duty which may be unexpectedly required;
this is the state we desire to be found in, and wish it was more our experience.
But we are poor,
and desire the prayers and sympathy of our dear friends
to whom we are united in the fellowship of suffering.

Twelfth month 1789.

When we prescribe for such as thou art, we must also take in the mind,
which often affects and is affected by the organs of the body.
Be an obedient child.
Now a child does not reason a great deal,
nor puzzle itself with a consideration of probable consequences;
its duty and its praise are simply to do as it is bid.
This is acceptable to the great father of the family in heaven and on earth;
this is uniting in the chorus, in the blest harmony; this is not interrupting, confusing,
or retarding the great work of glory to God, and good will to men,
but it is promoting and forwarding it according to the divine will.
The stars in their courses fought against Sisera: not only those of the first magnitude,
but we may believe the lesser stars also, seeing they fought in their courses.
Of whatever degree in the heavenly host, my beloved friend,
thou mayest esteem thyself to be,
(and I am sure I care not how little that is in thine own eyes) be thou encouraged
to persevere in unreserved dedication of all to the cause of Christ.
The kingdoms of this world seem in an unusual ferment,
and the bottom on which the false religions of it are founded, is altogether slight,
precarious, and uncertain.
Who knows how near the hour may be when it shall please the Omnipotent to rend the vail,
which obscures the spiritual sight of mankind,
and to reveal himself to the human species in a more general way, saying,
as at the beginning of creation, "`Let there be light, and there was light.`"
May you, who are called and chosen, and instructed, and fitted,
and furnished for the Master`'s service, be disencumbered and ready,
willingly to run on his errands with "`Here am I:
send me;`" diligently attending to the fresh and fresh pointings
and directions of wisdom in the course of your service:
so will the great and glorious work be likely to prosper in your hands,
and your peace will run down as a river through the present life,
bearing and supporting your spirits till you are conveyed
to the ocean and fullness of everlasting peace and joy.

Eleventh month 1790.

As I lay awake in bed this morning, thou occurred to me; and no wonder,
as thou art the frequent companion of my thoughts.
Thou seemed to me rather poor and low, like myself;
and I thought I would try if I could converse with thee in this manner.
I do not want to cut a flourish in praise of poverty; as some people,
instead of bowing down under and bearing the cross,
appear to me to ride exultingly and ostentatiously upon it:
but I want just to manifest by this little token of my sensibility
and affectionate sympathy with thee:
neither do I want to give thee advice on the occasion.
I am not so vain and foolish as to think thou standest in need of my advice.
Thou art a trained servant, and art acquainted by this time with thy Master`'s ways,
and manner: thou hast, though young in years, been long under his holy discipline,
and knowest that much exercise, conflict and probation,
is continually to be gone through within; in order to be made perfect,
thoroughly furnished unto all good works, as was said of the Master himself.
Though he were a son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered.
Thou hast drank deeply of divine consolation,
and thou hast known a walking in the light of the Lord;
yea thy path has been for a season as the shining light.
No wonder then that in turn thou should not only be stripped of thy priestly robes,
but like Joshua be clothed even with filthy garments, compassed with the troubles,
and perplexities, which belong to us as being also flesh.
I believe indeed that those, who ascend to the greatest heights of the holy hill,
and as instruments, are made most eminently useful:
I believe that those have to descend proportionably into the lower parts of the earth,
and have the greatest need to experience a being
buried with Christ by baptism unto death.
Such is the frailty and fallibility of our compound natures;
that the great author of them knows there is a necessity for our
undergoing repeated humiliations and abasements of self,
that we may repeatedly know and feel,
and be made thoroughly sensible of this important essential truth;
"`That we are not sufficient of ourselves even to think any good things as of ourselves:
but our sufficiency is of God.`"

To +++_________+++

O What an element is divine love! in this the children of the light live, and breathe,
and move, and act: there is no infection here; it is clear, pure, and salutary.
I would be glad that that poor man was effectually conquered.
Thou art dear to me for having so followed, and been so guided in service,
as to be instrumental of good in his case.

Thy prayers and thy alms-deeds, thy secret wrestlings of spirit,
and thy private labours and communications will, no doubt, come up in memorial.

I believe thou knowest that I received thine of the 5th ult.
the contents are such as this state of existence often affords:
it is indeed a cup of mixture;
but then it is wisely mixed and tempered by the great hand.
It it not for us poor, blind, and ignorant creatures to say, What doest thou?
but patiently to submit and reverently to bow in humble
persuasion that the judge of all the earth doeth right.
Well, it is glad tidings to me, that ye are getting on so bravely;
and no doubt cause of deep humiliation and gratitude to you both,
that the arm of everlasting strength has been experienced
in such renewed and such effectual support.
This is great encouragement to proceed in the track of revealed duty.
I believe many have greatly hurt themselves,
and become lame and dwarfish all their lives long,
by letting in the reasoner and the discourager,
consulting too much human prudence and propriety, limiting the spirit,
which is the Holy One, starting aside from services like an affrighted horse on the road,
and being in great fear where no fear is.
But thou, beloved friend, seemest to have got out of the bye-ways and crooked paths,
on to the high road for travellers, leading to the city of the great King;
and by continuing thus diligent, faithful, and devoted,
thou wilt (I trust) know more and more distinctly the Master`'s will,
and be more and more strengthened to perform it.
So if it be consistent with Infinite Wisdom to prolong thy life here,
thou wilt be happy in thyself, and useful in the creation of God;
and if a short warning should summon thee from this stage and conflict,
this mortal will put on immortality;
thy sorrows here be changed into unmixed everlasting joy;
and thy example and memorial will live, and teach, and preach to succeeding generations.

But alas, I am a poor weak, tottering creature, a much fitter object to be ministered to,
than qualified to minister to another.
Thou knowest where are hid thy effectual supplies, and in whom are all thy fresh springs.
Yet what I was made able to do, thou mayest be sure I was quite willing and glad to do,
to travail, to beg and to pray for thee.
I am glad that thou art out on service: it is the way for thee to grow strong,
and to get above the little glooms and recurring perplexities and despondencies,
which from various causes cast down and disquiet the soul.
By being thus employed, thou wilt through exercise become a trained servant,
and be made capable to instruct others, thy fellow-servants,
in the duties of their places and stations, feeding not only the lambs,
but the sheep of Christ.
Go on then, my dear friend; be not afraid of the face of man,
nor ashamed of the cross of Christ.
I repeat, (I have often repeated it) for I seem to have little new to say,
--no matter if fresh life be on the offering,--I repeat, that nothing more glorious,
more dignifying, more beneficial to mankind,
and more worthy of the dedication of all our faculties to espouse and promote,
ever was let down from heaven to earth.
Not only true civilization of manners, and sound morality,
but life and immortality (i. e. immortal life) and
eternal salvation are brought to light,
are made manifest through the gospel:
a dispensation of which (I doubt not) is committed to thee,
in order to advance according to thy gift and measure, these great and glorious ends.

LETTER.
XXIV.

Esteemed Friend,

I am concerned that it so falls out I cannot be at home personally to bid thee farewell,
and wish thee a good journey.
However, the travail of my soul is for the help, strength,
and safety of all our heavenly Father`'s children,
that they may be so wisely conducted in all things, as to know the returns of peace,
and feel the unity of the spirit, and of the body.

If we are little enough in our own eyes, we shall know divine strength in our weakness;
but when any apprehension of our strength and wisdom possesses the mind, weakness,
and loss in every respect ensue.
Thou hast my good wishes in the present concern;^
footnote:[A visit to Friends in America.]
it is indeed a weighty undertaking,
and requires a double portion of the spirit to go through.
Let thy dependance be upon the renewings of divine help,
and all thy movement in the gospel spirit.
Seek after the simplicity of truth, and its littleness: thou art going amongst a people,
many of whom have understanding hearts, and can discern wisely between spirit and Spirit,
between sound and substance; this I mention for thy encouragement,
if thou art single hearted.

May best wisdom direct thee in all thy steps, preserve thee solid in thy spirit,
lively in thy ministry, wise and discerning in thy conduct towards all,
and upright and exemplary in thy conversation!
I am thy sincere friend,

Samuel Fothergill.

LETTER XXV.

12th month 1769.

When I was informed of thy draught towards New England at this season of the year,
I felt a near sympathy with thee, as also with thy new companion;
looking over the stages and wide waters,
and thinking on the hard frost and high winds which are usual in the winter,
the journey has appeared difficult;
but my mind was turned to him who made and commands the winds and the waters;
whose Providence is over the ravens and the sparrows;
I believe thou understandest his language, and I trust thy ear will be attentive to him,
and in this there is safety in the greatest difficulties.

"`He that believeth maketh not haste,`" is a portion of doctrine
which I am inclined to recommend to thee in this journey;
should frozen rivers, or storms,
sometimes prevent thy going forward so fast as thou couldest desire,
it may be that thou wilt find a service in tarrying amongst a people,
whose company may not be, in all respects, agreeable.
I remember the way in which Paul made a visit to the island of Malta,
was contrary to his own mind, and yet by means of it,
the father of Publius was healed of his fever, and many cured of their infirmities.

Farewell, my dear friend, from

John Woolman.

LETTER XXVI.

Philadelphia, 26th Second month 1761

Dear Friend,

Friends here enquire after thee with great respect, and,
I believe many sympathize with thee,
both in thy inward and outward travels and conflicts,
with a comfortable hope of thy preservation.
Thy anxiety to accomplish the journey speedily may give thee pain in future,
unless thou carefully watchest,
that thy movements be not faster than true wisdom dictates.
It is also necessary to consider that we have bodies as well as souls,
and that there is a care due to them.
I wish not by this to encourage thy moving too slowly, for,
I believe diligence is commendable;
and those who have performed their duty with watchfulness, and care, and not loitered,
have left as sweet impression on the minds of their friends as some who have acted otherwise;
and I expect thy observations in thy travels, have convinced thee of this.
I am thy affectionate friend,

John Pemberton.

LETTER XXVII.

London, 18th Fifth month 1761.

Dear Friend,

Upon my coming up here to attend the service of the yearly meeting,
I was not a little rejoiced to find that thy getting to
London was just in time to save thy passage to America,
in the vessel proposed, with such agreeable company, and that the voyage was prosperous.

When I have looked back at these and other circumstances which I forbear to mention,
I have been confirmed in my mind that thy concern was right in this great undertaking,
and rightly timed;
and I doubt not this has been thy experience since thou crossed the great ocean.
Now dear friend,
may thy steppings along in service be with a single
eye to him who hath called thee forth,
even Christ the great head of the church,
who is able to furnish with wisdom and strength in every
exercise which thou mayest find thyself drawn into.
Thus thou wilt come to discharge the trust reposed in thee,
in a manner that will tend to stir up the lukewarm and indolent,
and comfort the feeble minded; as also procure the reward of peace in thy own bosom,
which, in due time, may accompany thee across the mighty waters to thy habitation.

Friends in this city are generally well:
it is true there are many under our name who do not trouble themselves much about religion;
yet a number are preserved who prefer the cause of truth above every consideration;
and that this concern may spread and increase to
the enlargement of the borders of our Zion,
is the desire of him who, with the salutation of brotherly affection,
remains thy sincere friend,

Isaac Wilson.

LETTER XXVIII.

To A Friend In England, +++[+++Translated from the Dutch.]

7th 3rd month 1769.

Dear Friend,

I Received thine of the 15th 11th month, last which was as a precious medicine to me,
after the great loss,
with which the Lord hath visited me in the removal of my dear companion,
who was my help in old age, my comforter in oppression, my partner in adversity: yea,
should I attempt to say, what help, comfort, and strength we mutually had, in each other,
both inwardly and outwardly, my heart would be overcome with grief,
in considering the loss of her company.

I shall therefore only say, in the words of king Solomon,
"`The price of a virtuous woman is far above rubies,
the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her: she will do him good, and not evil,
all the days of her life.`"

After a sickness of about three weeks, my beloved wife rested sweetly in the Lord,
in the sixty-fourth year of her age, and forty-second of our marriage.
She was very still and retired in her illness, and till the last day of her life,
the doctors thought she mended, from time to time;
but on that day they observed the contrary, which affected us so much the more:
and when she felt death approaching, she said, "`I have done,
O Father!`" thus cheerfully resigning her spirit to her Creator,
from whom it was received.

In her life she was of a grave disposition,
and her greatest delight was to meditate on the law of the Lord,
and to declare it to others,
bringing forth from the good treasures of her heart
that which was edifying to her friends and neighbours;
she manifested herself to be a true pillar in the temple of the Lord;
not decking herself with outward array,
but her adorning consisted in the incorruptible ornament of meekness,
wherewith the hidden man of the heart was filled.
In chastity, temperance, and good works, even as the holy women of old,
being established in the fear of the Lord.

Her ministry was not with words beautiful, according to the wisdom of man, nevertheless,
they were weighty, penetrating, and pleasant to the upright minded,
flowing from the power of God,
to the refreshment of the mournful travellers towards Zion.
She frequently recommended to the inward operation of the saving word,
the light of Christ, in order to walking therein.
And, in this labour of the gospel she continued many years.
The wild, unruly people, who attended our meetings,
were often restrained by the divine power, in her speaking.

At length it hath pleased the Lord to release her from her charge,
that she might rest from her labour, leaving to us, a savour of sweetness behind her;
yet it cannot be otherwise than a heavy stroke,
because the Lord had bestowed her upon me in his love and fatherly kindness,
in the early part of our time; it becomes us to say, Lord,
thy will be done in humble submission to the dispensations of his providence:
he is pleased to take that from us which we love most besides him,
that we should be more weaned from the love of the world,
and come to have our love fixed on him.

It was pleasant to me to perceive thy brotherly concern, and sympathy with us,
in our loss, as well on my account, as for our little society; I say loss, for so it is,
having lost two friends who appeared among us in the ministry, in one year; to wit,
my dear wife, and Abram Harmens, whose wife is likewise deceased.
Thus the number of friends here is greatly lessened; yet, through divine favour,
we often have very comfortable, though silent meetings; and we trust in that arm,
which hath hitherto been our defender.

I rest in true brotherly love and hearty well-wishing, thy affectionate friend,

John Vander Wert.

LETTER XXIX.

My Dear Friend,

With desires for thy advancement in the way of self-denial,
I shall speak a little of the dealings of the Almighty with me,
in the circumstances thou hast hinted at, viz. That when my spirit has been tendered,
and humbled, and brought into true contrition, I know it is of the Lord`'s goodness.
This operation in the soul, can be the effect of no other power,
because it lifts the soul to God, at whose presence the hills melt like wax,
the mountains of opposition are laid low, and the valleys exalted;
the rough ways are made smooth, bitter cups are sweetened,
the bread of life is dispensed to our souls,
and we are helped to draw water as from the wells of salvation.
These seasons of the love of God, I have thought,
are intended to excite our love and obedience to him,
and we are hereby made willing to submit to every dispensation, which he, in his wisdom,
is pleased to allot us: we can then say, "`Not my will, but thy will be done, O God.`"
We are helped to draw near to the throne of grace,
craving still to obtain mercy and help in time of need.

But let us remember times and seasons are in the hand of the Lord,
and he orders all things as he sees best for us; there are times of mourning,
as well as rejoicing: of want, as well as plenty;
of withdrawing his good presence to try our love and obedience:
and this has been the experience of all God`'s children.
We are subject to changes, and have need to be prepared for them;
in times of prosperity we are apt to take up our rest, and forget the dangers of the way.
But, as it was with Israel of old, we are not to rest in the wilderness,
though fed with food from heaven, but to be making advances in our spiritual journey;
still striving for the victory over enemies,
which oppose our progress to the land of rest; where may we happily meet,
ever more to praise and adore our gracious God,
and the Lamb who hath washed us in his precious blood.
So prayeth thy affectionate friend,

Sophia Hume.

LETTER XXX.

Bromley, 2nd Twelfth month 1736.

Dear Friend,

When I was last in the north, I heard of thee in divers places,
as one who had turned thy face Zionwards;
having seen the emptiness of earthly enjoyments.

The prayer of my mind is to the Almighty on thy account,
that he would be pleased to favour thee with such a degree of his love,
as might enable thee to take up a holy resolution
to follow thy Lord and Saviour in singleness of heart,
according to his leading; though it may be in the way of affliction and sorrow, yet,
as this good resolution is kepi to, still to follow him,
who in his great love hath visited thy soul; he will set before thee an open door,
which no man can shut, by which thy poor soul may enter in, and find rest in him,
who is the true rest of his people.
And the nearer thou dwells to him, in spirit,
the more wilt thou be made to partake of that sweet
peace which he gives to his obedient followers;
and the more wilt thou come to be acquainted with his heavenly teachings,
in which there is spirit, and life, whereby the soul is put into a capacity,
both to know and do those things which belong to its everlasting peace:
not regarding the world, or the vanities of it,
but looking forward towards that which is durable and excellent in glory.

It is my desire for thee, that thine eye may be more and more fixed on heavenly things,
and that thou mayest daily know a drinking of the well of salvation,
which Christ hath opened in the hearts of true believers;
that thus thou might be wholly weaned from the breast of this world,
and might drink abundantly of that joy which flows from the breasts
of Divine consolation in Christ our bishop and true shepherd.

To his protection I commit thee, with my own soul, and remain thy companion and sister,
as thou follows the Lamb in patience and tribulation,

Deborah Bell.

P+++.+++ S.--I hear thy freedom, as to the outward, is enlarged; may thy freedom,
and liberty of soul,
daily increase through the power of him that is come to set his
children free to serve him in simplicity and singleness of heart.

LETTER XXXI.

Balby, near Doncaster.

Dear Friend,

The reading thy letter gave me great satisfaction,
as it informs me thou art treated with less severity than heretofore.

Though thy education has been among those who, for want of knowing our principles,
may have imbibed wrong notions of us, yet charity induces me to hope,
thy relations endeavours to prevent thy joining in society with us,
are merely the effect of their good-will and esteem for thee:
this should lead them to think, that no one`'s conscience ought to be forced;
and that it is necessary, in matters of religion, we should choose for ourselves;
and be left to act according to our own judgment.
Our Saviour Jesus Christ did not seek to plant bis church by force,
or use violence towards the Jews, to cause them to submit to his doctrine.

If thou keepest thy mind fixed upon God,
and in humility callest upon him to lead thee in the way of the cross,
he will more and more make known his mind and will,
and give thee to see what he is pleased with, and what offends him.
He knows thy wants; and as thou hungers and thirsts after him,
and longest to be fed by the bread which he gives,
he will in due time satisfy the desires of thy soul,
and make thee a sharer with his people of the good things of his house.
Be obedient to his call, give up thy heart to God, without reserve,
save nothing alive in thee, which he hath appointed for death.
Be as passive clay in the hand of the potter;
then he will reconcile and make all things easy, and form thee as a vessel to his praise.

This, from thy real friend,

Thomas Smith.

LETTER XXXII.

I Have had a deep fellow-feeling with thee in thy late affliction, and a secret hope,
that it might please the Father of mercies to raise thee up,
and sanctify thy troubles to thee:
that being more fully acquainted with that way which the world calls foolishness,
thou mayest obtain the clothing of divine fortitude,
and be strengthened to resist the spirit which leads from the simplicity of the truth.

We may find ourselves crippled,
and halting from a strong bias to things which are pleasant and easy to be come at,
so that it is to appearance impossible to advance forward;
but things impossible with man, are possible with God;
and our wills being subjected to the divine will, all temptations are surmountable.
This work of refinement is compared to the mineral in the furnace, which,
through fervent heat, is reduced from its original state,
and a separation made between the precious and the vile: it is declared of Christ,
that by the operation of his spirit, he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver,
and shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver,
that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness.
(Mal.
iii.)

By these comparisons we are instructed in the necessity
of the operation of the hand of God upon us,
to prepare our hearts truly to submit to him, and to manifest our submission,
by turning away from that spirit, in all its workings, which is not of him.

To forward this work, the all-wise God is pleased sometimes, by outward distress,
to bring us near the gates of death; that life being made painful and afflicting,
and the prospect of eternity before us, all earthly hands may be loosened;
and the mind prepared for that deep and sacred instruction,
which otherwise would not be received.
As kind parents love their children, and delight in their happiness, so he,
who is perfect goodness, in sending abroad mortal contagions,
doth assuredly direct their use.
Are the righteous removed by them?
Their change is happy.
Are the wicked taken away in their wickedness?
The Almighty is clear.
Do we pass through great bitterness, and suffering, and yet recover?
It is intended that we should be more purged from dross, and our ear opened to discipline.

And now, after thy sore affliction, and doubts of recovery, as thou art again restored,
forget not him who hath helped thee, but in humble gratitude, hold fast his instruction;
by which thou art shewn the bypaths that lead from the firm foundation.
I am sensible of the dangers to which thou art exposed, from a variety of company,
in transacting thy business; having painfully felt the force of conversation with men,
deeply rooted in an earthly mind,
I can sympathize with thee and others in such conflicts,
in that much weakness still attends me.

I find, that to be a fool, as to worldly wisdom, and to commit my cause unto God,
not fearing to displease men, who take offence at the simplicity of truth,
is the way to remain unmoved.
The fear of man brings a snare; by halting in our duty,
and giving back in times of trial, our hands grow weaker;
our spirits get mingled with the people; our ears grow dull,
as to hearing the language of the true shepherd, so that,
when we look at the way of the sincere followers of Christ,
it seems as if it was not for us to walk in their footsteps.

There is a love clothes my mind, whilst I am writing this,
which is superior to all expression;
and my heart is open to encourage thee to a holy emulation,
to advance forward in Christian firmness.

Humility is a strong bulwark, and as we enter into it we find safety.
Being unclothed of our own wisdom, and knowing the abasement of the creature,
therein we find that life to arise, which gives health and vigour to us.

John Woolman.

LETTER XXXIII.

Exeter, 14th 8th month 1747.

Dear Friend,

I Have often had thee, and divers other friends of Leominster, in my remembrance,
since I was at your yearly meeting;
and the sense I had concerning the state of some young friends there, was,
that the Lord`'s hand has been upon you for good; to regulate your conduct,
so that you may shine as lights in your several departments; and show forth his praise,
who hath called you out of darkness, into his marvellous light;
and hath set on your countenances the self-denying
impressions of the image of Jesus Christ.
May you also evidence to the world,
by blessed degrees of the meekness of the Lamb of God, that you belong to his fold;
and are encompassed about with the pale of his salvation, where neither wolf, nor lion,
or any other beast of prey, can ever destroy.
For this know, that no destroyer can hurl the sheep and lambs of Christ,
as they abide in God`'s holy mount, where true safety is.
Happy are those who gather to this, and dwell therein; the Lord is their refuge,
and strength, their present help in trouble;
even though the powers of the earth may be removed,
and all the force established by human policy, should be dashed in pieces,
and brought to nought by the confusion of national, unstable powers;
yet the meek inhabitants of God`'s Mount Sion shall endure the shock,
how terrible soever it may be to the workers of iniquity.
They shall have recourse to that celestial river,
the streams whereof make glad the city of our God;
and this shall be the seed which the Lord will bless, as his generation, born from above,
raised up through the Lord`'s power to replenish the earth with the righteousness,
holiness and purity of the saints, restored to them through faith in the Son of God.

The sense of God`'s loving kindness and regard to his sheep and lambs,
who hear his voice, and follow him,
bows all the faculties of my soul into reverent thankfulness and praise,
to him who is over all worthy for ever and ever.

As the design of the Father of Mercies is to dignify the church of the
New Testament with such precious gifts and graces of his beloved Son,
as may demonstrate the virtue of his power to the gathering the scattered in Israel,
and dispersed in Judah, to his light and truth in themselves,
until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; it behoves thee, and me,
and all the Lord`'s visited people, to see that we walk in this light;
that we live in subjection and obedience to the present discoveries thereof,
both in doing and in suffering,
without postponing our obedience to any time beyond the present requirings of his spirit.

When the waters of life move inwardly in our Christian assemblies to our refreshment,
we are made glad; if they rest there,
the refreshment and comfort is only for our own growth, and establishment in the truth,
for which we have cause to be thankful and circumspect.
Yet if the divine virtue with which the soul is replenished is
accompanied with a concern for the refreshment of others also,
then the doctrine contained in this special visitation of God,
under the direction of heavenly wisdom, (for which we have need to ask,
that all may be done to the praise of God,
and edification of his church) belongs to the brethren and sisters then present;
and is like bread, to be broken, and dispensed to others, at the divine command,
that they may feed with us, and be satisfied with the present provision of our God;
and may be enabled to gather up the fragments, and keep them in memory,
till such times as these remains may be renewedly blessed to them.

I sate down to salute thee in a spring of love,
but in such poverty as teaches the soul to look to the Lord, that he may be our helper.
In this love I freely impart to thee what has been received,
leaving it to the divine blessing to be disposed of for thy advantage.

I bid thee farewell, remaining a well wisher to all,

Lawford Godfrey.

LETTER.
XXXIV.

The Lord is the all-wise disposer of events.
He maketh rich, and maketh poor.
He exalteth, and abaseth, at his pleasure.
Though I most firmly believe,
that God doth not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men;
that he is a God of mercy, and knoweth all our wants,
and will add all which his wisdom sees best to those who first seek his kingdom,
and the righteousness thereof; yet I am obliged to confess with respect to his outward,
as well as inward administrations of prosperity and adversity,
his judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.

It is obvious, that trouble is often the result of our own perverseness,
and arises from the determination of an unsanctified will;
the imprudence of our undertakings, and folly of our choice;
but then it is equally evident, that it sometimes arises from a different source,
and must necessarily be resolved into the wise and inscrutable providence of God.
What shall we say of Job, that perfect man`'s condition?
Of the hunger, thirst, and nakedness of the apostles?
Of those who wandered about in sheep-skins, and goat-skins, destitute and afflicted,
of whom the world was not worthy; and of the Holy Jesus,
who had not where to lay his head?

The condition of Christians in the early ages was straight, and since,
of many of the first reformers, who have been true successors of the apostles;
treated as the offscouring of all things; to whom indeed the earth has been as iron,
though the heavens have not been as brass.
Far be it from me to conclude these to be unhappy, or think they had cause to complain;
surely they were blessed, and received in this life, recompense, a thousand fold,
for all their sufferings.
But I instance them to shew, that even the favourites of heaven,
as well as those who through disobedience frustrate the designs of God`'s mercy, may be,
and sometimes are, tried with a scarcity of the outward accommodations of this life.

Riches are not certain marks of divine favour,
nor prosperity an evidence that our ways please God.
Doth he not sometimes give men their hearts desire,
and withal send leanness into their souls?
We are apt to call providences by wrong names.
Afflictions we call evils, and riches we call blessings, when for once they prove so,
it is to be feared they are a thousand times more often to the possessors a judgment.
The distresses and troubles of outward Israel, were often permitted in mercy,
when the people, in fulness, and prosperity, had revolted from God,
in order to bring them back again to him, so as to trust in him,
and have their dependence upon him.
And if this be the gracious design of the Almighty now, in the administration of crosses,
and adversity to us, they deserve to be considered as evidences of his merciful regard;
who, in this severe, yet more intelligible language to earthly hearts,
is seeking to convince us of our dependence upon him, and that it is he who can bless,
or blast, all our endeavours.

I have often thought that if we were more attentive
to the secret intimations of the great counsellor,
who speaks from heaven in our hearts,
we should make it less necessary for the Lord to
speak to us so frequently in the language of affliction.
By attending to this good guide, we should avoid every snare,
and be enabled to go forward in the line of duty,
and be contented in the lot of our appointment;
though our dwelling might be with the lowly: yet, divested of anxious care,
we should rest secure in his providence, who numbers the hairs of our head,
clothes the lilies with transcending beauty, and hears the young ravens when the cry.

If we are concerned to worship the Lord our God,
to bless him in the lot which he hath assigned us, he will bless our bread,
and our water; and, if consistent with the designs of his wisdom,
he can increase our corn and oil, and multiply our gold and silver.
It is true, that cross occurrences, and afflictions,
have not always their desired or intended effects.
The Lord complained of a people formerly, saying, "`I sent unto them blasting and mildew,
and yet they will not heed me.
I have smitten them, and they refused to receive instruction.`"

There is an aptness in the human mind,
(which looks not beyond things that are natural) to rest in second causes,
and blind to the discriminating providence of the Most High,
to fix the blame on secondary agents; but surely affliction cometh not from the dust,
neither doth trouble spring out of the ground.
Oh, that in the medium of divine light we might look up to God:
therein we should discover the secret turnings of the holy hand in these things;
for I am persuaded, that whatever is permitted to try us, whether inwardly, or outwardly,
it is from the dispensation of unerring wisdom and goodness, and the best for us,
in our present state of mind, and consistent with our chiefest good.

What cause have we therefore to commit ourselves wholly to him, and to bless his name,
in every dispensation; who is the sole arbitrator of heaven, and earth;
who superintends the universe; whose goodness and power are equal;
who knows all situations, and is graciously administering to every one of us,
in uniform mercy, what is most suitable to our states;
and all for this most desirable purpose, to gather us to himself,
who is the fullness of blessing and of life.

LETTER XXXV.

12th Twelfth month 1776.

Dear Friend,

In a degree of that love, which neither time nor outward distance,
nor death can dissolve: wherein such sympathy is felt,
that we can rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep:
in the renewings of this love, thou hast been often brought to my remembrance of late,
and there hath been presented to my mind some remarks,
which I have liberty to offer to thy consideration.

When that deeply humbled and tried servant of the Lord, David,
was favoured to partake of the refreshing streams of that river,
whose source is the ocean of everlasting love;
when his feet were set on a rock that was higher than he;
and the new song was put into his mouth;
at these seasons he thought his mountain stood strong,
and was ready to say in his prosperity, that he should never be moved.
Yet afterwards he was so far tried as to be almost ready to conclude he was forsaken,
making use of this humble plaintive language,
"`Will the Lord cast off for ever I will he be favourable no more?
Are his mercies clean gone for ever?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious?
Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies?`"
Thus, this righteous man,
having experienced preservation and deliverances in the heights and in the depths,
was instructed to serve the Lord with fear, and to rejoice with trembling.

When the Lord saw meet to hide his face from him, and to suffer fresh trials to attend,
we find him availing himself of the mercy by which he had been often delivered and restored;
and though he was at times much dejected, yet his faith was so remaining,
and strengthened in that power by which he had been raised from the sheep-cote,
to be the Lord`'s servant, that he could thus address himself: "`Why art thou cast down,
O my soul?
Why art thou disquieted within me?
Hope thou in God, for I shall yet praise him, who is the health of my countenance,
and my God.`"

Alas, why should that wholesome discipline,
which consummate wisdom and goodness hath ever exercised upon those whom
he hath made willing to bear the refining operation of his holy hand,
seem strange to any of us?
"`Gold is tried in the fire, and acceptable men in the furnace of affliction.`"
If it thus became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things,
in bringing many sons unto glory,
to make the captain of our salvation perfect through suffering;
if he was a man of sorrow, and acquainted with grief;
is it not enough for the disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord.

As there are various causes of suffering, so there are various baptisms and trials.
Our different conditions require a different discipline, and the designs of God upon us,
make it necessary for us to be brought under a variety of operations.
All the faithful in former times were not brought under those particular,
and for the present, grievous exercises, which the prophets were,
in order to prepare them for the work whereunto they were called.
It is true the judgments of the Lord are unsearchable, and his ways past finding out:
"`Who,`" saith the apostle, "`hath known his mind, or been his counsellor?`"
Secret things belong to him, and things which are revealed, to us and to our children.

If all the holy patriarchs, prophets, apostles, martyrs, and confessors of Jesus,
have like their blessed Lord, been men of sorrows, and acquainted with grief,
and had to enter the kingdom through many tribulations, can we doubt,
whether these trials, which God, only wise, permitted, or appointed to them,
were mercies in disguise!
Is there not room to think they were made the means of preservation in his fear,
and of bringing them nearer to him; so as to rely more firmly upon him,
who is the only sure refuge in times of trouble,

Have not all the afflictions of the righteous been thus sanctified to them?
And will not the endless hallelujah which they shall have to sing,
be unto him who hath redeemed their souls out of all adversity,
and made their garments white in the blood of the Lamb?
Our troubles of every kind are all known to God, who careth for us,
with the most fatherly affection.
Why then should Sion say, or why should the watchers on her walls say,
"`The Lord hath forsaken me, and my God hath forgotten me.`"

However unmindful he may seem to be of the distresses and dangers which threaten us,
when the tempest arises and the enemy breaketh in as a flood;
yet in his own time he will arise, and rebuke the wind and the waves, for their sake;
and, by the effective word of his power, once more say: "`Peace, be still.`"
But if it should seem best to him, who is wonderful in council,
and doeth all things right,
to lead any of his people in the line of the glorious process of his dear Son;
should the final cup and baptism be the most trying and bitter;
should our dying words under these painful feelings be expressed
in that moving language of the Son of God,
"`Eloi, Eloi, lama sabacthani,`" I should have no doubt of the righteous souls,
thus tried, ascending from this cross, and apparent dereliction,
to an immortal crown of righteousness, and mansion of eternal glory;
no more doubt of the happiness of these,
than if I saw them ascending in the fiery chariot of sensible, soul-rejoicing,
celestial fervor!
I know not how sufficiently to inculcate this most certain truth,
That the children of God are never more under his notice, and tender regard,
than in seasons of their deepest humiliations; directing, blessing,
and sanctifying every dispensation to humbled souls.
Thus is he carrying on his work, though we see it not.

O, that thou mayest not be discouraged, nor sink under the present exercise,
nor murmur as some of old murmured,
but endeavour to enter in perfect resignation to the will of God;
and then all things will work together for thy good;
and for thy additional preparation to glorify his holy name, in time and in eternity.
Amen.

From thy real friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER XXXVI.

17th Seventh month 1777.

My Dear and Much Esteemed Friend,

Thou hast been often brought to my remembrance, in much nearness;
and the sense and judgment with which my mind is impressed concerning thee is,
that the dispensation thou art now under is the effect of unsearchable love and wisdom;
and that the arms of mercy are underneath for thy support.
My greatest concern and prayer is,
that the present painful baptism may be sanctified to thy own advantage,
and the benefit and edification of the church:
for these excellent purposes what can be too much to do or to suffer,
according to the will of God?
It was for this that Jesus Christ our Lord vouchsafed
to descend from the heights of immortality,
and take upon him the form of a servant, to bear the contradiction of sinners,
the temptation of the enemy, and offer up himself upon the cross,
an everlasting sacrifice to God for the sins of the whole world.
It was for this that he, who alone was able, trod the wine-press alone,
stained all his garments, and drank the cup of trembling,
and was baptized with the baptism of suffering, even unto death.
Oh, that all of us, who are desirous of being found in him,
may be at least content to walk, as he walked,
in the depths of abasement and humiliation, wherein he may be pleased to lead us,
until he shall say, It is enough.

Strait and narrow the way to the kingdom hath always been, attended with difficulties,
and entered into through many tribulations;
yet the commandments of the Lord are not grievous;
in keeping his law there is great delight; there is a recompense a thousand fold,
even in this life, for all our sufferings,
in the enjoyment of that peace which passeth the human understanding;
as the earnest of that great and eternal weight of glory,
with which our sufferings in this world are not to be compared.

Without controversy great is the mystery of godliness,
far surpassing the comprehension of man;
and those parts of it in which we are deeply interested, we can only see into,
and understand as he who hath the key of David, the lion of the tribe of Judah,
is pleased to unloose the seals, and open unto us.
How necessary is it then for us to take heed to the advice of the apostle,
not to judge before the time: he even saith, "`I judge not myself.`"
Our duty, and interest, our advancement in the divine life,
consisteth not in our comprehending in theory, but following in obedience,
and in the simplicity of children.
Be not then, my friend, anxious about the cause, the duration,
or the effects of thy present humiliation,
but endeavour to cast all thy care upon him who careth for thee; put thy trust in God,
without whose permission not a hair of thy head shall perish.
He sees every circumstance of thy mournful condition;
when the enemy is permitted to buffet thee, and thou art tossed as with a tempest,
and not comforted, he knows these things, who is omnipotent,
who hath set bars and doors to the sea,
and ascertained the point whereto its proud waves shall arise,
and they can go mo further.

These things, I am persuaded, thou knowest, and art endeavouring to practise;
yet suffer me to say something which may tend to strengthen and encourage thy perseverance
in a total resignation of thyself to the disposal of Almighty power and goodness;
to God, thy Saviour, who doth not willingly afflict the children of men.

Though thou mayest seem to thyself to lie as among the pots,
and to be as a broken vessel, yet it is my belief,
thou wilt be brought forth as the dove whose wings are covered with silver,
and her feathers with yellow gold.
If it will avail any thing to thy comfort, I can assure thee,
thou art far from being alone in tribulation: I mean not as to outward troubles,
but those which result from the concern we have in the impending
judgments of the Lord on a backsliding generation.
And the general state of the church among ourselves,
wherein the prevalence of the nature and spirit of the world,
and the famine of that word whose entrance giveth life,
furnish abundant cause to the living for mourning, yea for unspeakable distress.
We are however favoured at seasons in the vision of divine light,
with a prospect of better times,
wherein the Lord will in mercy turn again our captivity as the streams of the south.

My faith, as an individual,
is strengthened to believe that the time will come
when the gospel shall be preached in all nations,
and the Lord`'s name come to be great among the Gentiles; and that in every place,
from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof,
incense shall be offered to his name, and a pure offering.
Upon the whole, I cannot forbear to add,
that I wish myself more worthy of the sufferings of the present day,
and that I was more worthy to express these things in this manner to thee.

With much affection I subscribe myself, thy brother in Christ Jesus,

John Thorp.

LETTER XXXVII.

23rd Eighth month 1778.

My Dear Friend,

I May tell thee I feel much concern for thee in thy present suffering state,
yet I have to believe all will work together for thy good,
and that in the Lord`'s time thy soul shall be set
at liberty and filled forever with his praise.
The Lord`'s ways are not our ways; his thoughts are not our thoughts;
one day is with him as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
The designs, the concealed mercy, in his varied dispensations,
are beyond our comprehension.
This we know, that with him there is no variableness, neither shadow of turning:
that having loved his own, he loveth them to the end;
that through whatever tribulations or conflicts he may lead them,
it is his good pleasure to give them the kingdom.

Be not then discouraged when the enemy is permitted to buffet thee;
endeavour to stand still in these times of trial,
and in the Lord`'s time thou wilt have to experience his complete salvation.
The most dignified of the children of God have been led in paths of unutterable humiliation,
and abasement, in the course of their purification:
yet none that trusted in the Lora and abode in his fear, ever were confounded.
When have there been any whom he prepared for a habitation with him in glory,
that have not drunk of his cup, and been baptized with his baptism, in a certain degree?

The language in which all the redeemed of our God have been instructed,
in a lesser or greater degree, is, "`I am a worm, and no man;
I am like a broken vessel.`"
It was the question proposed by our blessed Lord to the two apostles,
who were emulous to sit at bis right and left hand in glory:
"`Are ye able to drink of the cup that I drink of,
and to be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized?`"
Now what was this cup, and what was this baptism,
which it was needful they should in degree partake oil It was a cup of agonizing distress,
a baptism into the deepest suffering, even unto death:
the depth of which is awfully set forth in that expostulation,
"`Why hast thou forsaken me?`"
This was the baptism, through which the Holy Jesus had to pass.
This was the cup which, though intolerable to human nature, he was desirous to drink of,
according to the will of God: in humble resignation thus expressing himself, "`Father,
if this cup may not pass from me, except I drink it, thy will be done.`"

This is the acceptable state wherein no choice is found,
no desire arises but what is circumscribed by, and centers in, "`Not my will, but thine,
be done.`"
It is to reduce us to this state that all the varied turnings of the holy hand,
and dispensations of God`'s providences are directed; in this state,
whether we are called to unite in the hosanna to our adorable Redeemer,
or go with him over the brook Cedron, we are equally acceptable to him:
it is to this state all things are sanctified, whether it be to reign,
or suffer with Christ: whether the north, or the south wind blows upon it,
the spices equally flow out, and ascend as incense acceptable unto the God of heaven,
and of the whole earth.
Attend not therefore to the discouragements which the enemy may cast before thee;
for I believe thou wast never more under the divine notice than in this season of trouble.
Though thou feel not the uniform prevalence of that power,
unto which the devils are subject, yet in this rejoice,
said our holy Redeemer to his people, that your names are written in heaven.

Should thy present state be a painful, dark, and imprisoned state, yet permit me to say,
Fear not: the Lord is on thy side, and in his own time he will open the prison doors,
and say to the prisoner, Go forth; and to them that are in darkness,
shew yourselves in the light.
How canst thou think at any time, that thou art finally forsaken of God:
though he see meet to hide his face from thee at seasons, does his compassions ever fail?
Are not his promises sure?
Hath he not delivered thee out of six troubles,
and is his arm shortened that it cannot still save?
Hath he vouchsafed, in unspeakable love, to draw thy soul after him, in infant years,
and to reveal himself to thee, as the stay of thy youth, and will he now forsake thee?
No, it is not so;
he is the same as he was when thy soul was first enamoured with his love.
His regard is as much towards thee as ever; and as he has Seen thy morning light,
and the stay of thy youth, so he will be thy evening song, and the staff of thy old age.
Let thy hope and trust be in him,
and in his own time he will give thee the desire of thy heart;
and thou shalt have to praise him as on the banks of deliverance;
and tell of his wonders in the deep: who is a God infinite in power and wisdom,
whose mercy endureth for ever, and of whose loving-kindness there is no end.

I desire the increase and establishment of thy health,
and in order to it wish thee to take as much exercise
within and without doors as thou art capable of,
without weariness.

I am, with love unfeigned, thy friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER XXXVIII.

17th 6th month 1779.

My Dear Friend,

I Cannot with ease omit this opportunity of acknowledging the receipt of thy letter:
be assured, no want of friendship towards thee, or of attention to the subject,
has been the cause that I have not answered it sooner;
but chiefly because I have had nothing to say, which has not, at least in substance,
been said before: my faith, and hope, and all my feelings concerning thee,
when clothed with a right mind, being invariably the same.

I am abundantly persuaded,
that however in thy own apprehension thou mayst stand in
need of compassion and help from the least of thy friends,
yet, I know, that he who made and supports all worlds,
with whom are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge, who hath all power in heaven,
and on earth, is thy Saviour, thy shield, and thy exceeding great reward.

With regard to the distressing probations of thy present state, I pray, in faith,
that thou mayest be supported under and to the end of them all;
that the gracious design of the Almighty may he fully answered concerning thee.
What I feel of trouble for thee is, on account of thy suffering,
for I have no fear or doubt respecting the issue of thy present conflicts.
When I have read thy letters,
those which have been most replete with lamentation and fear,
I have been so far from feeling any degree of discouragement on
thy account that my faith has been raised to a degree of assurance,
that no one is in a safer state.
Is the cause of thy grief a painful uncertainty,
whether thy suffering originates in mind or body?
Whether on thy account, as an evil doer,
or in a state of union with the holy suffering seed;
filling up what remains of the afflictions of Christ, for his body`'s sake,
which is the church;
whether purely a dispensation of the Almighty for thy more perfect purification;
or whether arising only from the natural causes, in the constitution of the human frame?
Is the clear knowledge of these things veiled, or hid from thyself or others?
And why is it so?
Doth not Infinite Wisdom deal with us in this manner,
because he knows it is best it should be concealed, just in the manner and degree it is?

Oh that thou couldest but cast all thy caring and anxious
solicitude about these things upon him who careth for thee;
and think of nothing but how thou might come to the most
perfect submission and resignation to the will of God.
I believe this is thy desire and concern, therefore I have to believe,
that however thy present trial may be permitted, to continue or increase;
though the furnace should be heated to a greater degree than it has been;
yet that thou wilt be brought forth with so much the greater brightness and purity,
without so much as the smell of tire having passed on thy garments.
Great is the safety of this resigned humble depending state; and truly,
the fitness and necessity of it are equal to its safety, for what are we,
and what have we to boast of but our abundant infirmities: beset as we are,
in this state of probation, from within and without,
what can the willings and runnings of the creature avail?
Or what have we to trust in or depend upon but God, who sheweth mercy,
and that mercy is Christ Jesus.

I commend thee, then, dear friend, with myself, into the arms of this everlasting mercy,
for safety and preservation;
for he is that salvation which God hath appointed for walls and bulwarks;
and the more thou art reduced, as to a dependance on thy own strength,
the more will his strength be manifested in thy salvation:
the deeper thou descendest in suffering and humiliation,
the higher shalt thou rise in dominion with thy suffering glorified Redeemer: for,
as said the apostle, "`If we be dead with Christ, we shall also live with him.`"
It is therefore in my heart to say, Be careful for nothing, but in every thing,
by prayer and supplication, let thy wants be made known unto God.
Cast all thy care upon him, both with regard to body and soul,
and he will be every thing to thee which thou standest in need of,
according to the riches of his mercy, in Christ Jesus.

A degree of sympathy with thee hath been raised in my heart,
that thy present humiliation and comparative uselessness
in thy own apprehension in respect to former service,
affects thee with generous concern, on the church`'s account, wherein, indeed,
the labourers are but few.
But remember, my dear friend, that the work and the power too, are the Lord`'s,
that he can work by many, or by few, with, or without instruments;
to him then let us commit his own cause, desiring nothing for for ourselves,
but that his will may be done in us, and by us, as it is done in heaven.

I have only to add, that to do any thing to injure our health,
or which may tend to shorten our days, is certainly wrong;
the blessing of natural life and health,
deserves our grateful acknowledgment and attention; and I consider it to be offensive,
either to hurt or destroy it, from a want of due resignation.
In the fellowship of the gospel, I subscribe myself thy affectionate friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER XXXIX.

Redruth, 29th Twelfth month 1792.

Dear Friend,

Thy affectionate remembrance of me is salutary:
and thy remarks respecting our endeavours,
(though enfeebled by age and infirmity) to fill up our days
work so as to be favoured with peace in the close of it,
are weighty.
May the Almighty strengthen my weak mind to believe,
and assist me in the performance of his will, in the few remaining hours allotted me.

I am quite a cripple, but can still write,
though my friends admire I can do it so legibly.
I esteem it a great favour that I can bear to be carried to our meeting,
which is held just at our back door.
When thyself and wife were in our county it was far otherwise;
even to see my friends was then difficult.
I was for several years the Lord`'s prisoner;
I never arraigned his justice or wisdom in his dealing with me;
my reasoning faculties were not lost,
although the enemy was permitted to cause me to believe strange things;
so far as my deliverance is wrought, the Lord`'s hand hath done it.
Man could do nothing,
though I doubt not but that the prayers of my friends were heard with acceptance.

I note what thou sayest of thy intended visit to Pyrmont;
if the concern is removed from thee, I wish it may rest upon some other servant.
To visit the convinced, who inhabit dark countries, is a truly charitable labour.
Since my residence in this county I have for some books on religious subjects,
in the Danish, and High Dutch, into the hands of some who could read them.

Thy account of the state of the society in your county is truly acceptable;
I hope I may say it is the same in this corner of the nation;
indeed it appears to be so in many parts of it;
so that although our numbers may be small, I hope we are yet as lights in the world,
and that the time will come,
when an increase of faithful testimony-bearers to the truth professed by us,
will be apparent.

I now conclude with the salutation of true love to thyself, and thy valuable wife.
My dear love is also to S. B. and to other friends of my acquaintance,
to whom my spirit hath been nearly united.
May the Lord have us all in his keeping to the end of time,
is the desire of thy affectionate friend,

Catherine Phillips.

Extracts From An Epistle Of Stephen Crisp.

It lies upon me to warn you, my dear friends, to watch against the spirit of  this world,
lest it drink up your spirits too much,
in an eager pursuit after the things of this world, which happens to several,
in divers ways, to their great hurt, and damage; and the snare lies deep and hidden,
under a subtle covering.
For whereas it is the duty of every man to take care for his family,
and to be diligent in the calling God hath placed him in,
and to improve such opportunities as are put into his hands;
yet here the enemy works to make the care immoderate; to turn the diligence to slavery,
and the improving opportunities to a searching out for them, sometimes by indirect means,
to the prejudice of their neighbour:
and all to satisfy a greedy desire after heaping up treasure in this world;
and through earnestness of the affection, that kindles more and more,
a man comes to have the increase,
or decrease of these things to be the objects of his joy or sorrow;
and then he is miserable, for joy or sorrow are the highest faculties of the mind,
and ought to be placed on the highest objects, and not upon transitory things.

But, alas! how many are cast down at losses, and lifted up at profits and gains?
Oh! my friends, take heed of this fickle and uncertain state;
for while some have set their minds upon the things of this world,
and placed their trust in uncertain riches, they have erred from the faith;
and if at any time they have taken their wings and fled away,
their hope has gone with them; therefore be cautious of having your spirits sharpened,
and set on edge about these outward things:
take heed not to enlarge your trades and business beyond your ability or capacity,
for both these evils have been the ruin of some;
as every one that hath ability hath not capacity, for great things,
and every one that hath capacity, hath not ability;
and where either of these are wanting, such ought to be content with low and mean things,
such as they are capable to manage, and able to reach; not to lean too much upon the one,
and then seek, by indirect means, to make the other answerable;
for no man knows the issue beforehand,
and therefore ought to wait to know the guidance of the Lord,
and to be subject unto his will, though in the cross to their own.

As the apostle has noticed, concerning those who said, We will go to yonder city,
and will buy and sell, and get gain, which were lawful things in themselves,
yet for this they ought to have said, "`If the Lord will.`"
So he that intends to increase his trade, and enlarge his adventures,
so that his gains may be enlarged, even in this, he ought to say, "`If the Lord will.`"

O friends, wait to feel the governing hand of God in these things,
to direct and govern you in your affairs: that so he may be really acknowledged by you,
the Lord of the earth, as well as heaven; the ruler of your tradings and dealings,
as well as of your religion and profession.

Stephen Crisp

LETTER XL.

Chard, 13th Tenth month 1718.

Dearly Beloved Friend,

Thine of the 15th of ninth month is before me,
with which I was so affected in the feeling of that love from whence it proceeded,
that I thought to return a speedy answer; but through frailty of memory,
and other infirmities, it has been deferred until now.
I observe thou takest notice of my making no reply to what thou
says concerning the burial of our good friend William Penn;
I hope thou wilt readily believe, it was not for want of love; I can truly say,
that I never loved any man better on a religious or civil account.
Although we have had many other valuable friends, to me,
dear William Penn exceeded them all.
The reading his works has been more profitable to me than that of many others,
especially his book, entitled, No Cross, No Crown; In short, I can say,
with a sincere desire to the Lord, my soul be with his.

I hope, dear friend, thou wilt accept of this scribble; I am become weak,
through the infirmities of age; and such deafness is attending,
that they are frequently obliged to write, to make me understand.
But I can look back with comfort, and remember the Lord`'s great love,
in calling me to work in his vineyard, in which he hath also strengthened me,
and given me a plentiful reward, blessed be his name for ever.

My honest wife, (as dear William Penn used to call her) is indifferent well,
considering her age, which I prize as a great mercy.
Mine, and her dear love is to thee, and thy wife, and to my loving friend Henry Gouldney,
with any other friends in thy freedom.

So remain thy sincere, and for many kindnesses, much obliged friend,

Elias Osborne.

LETTER XLl.

London Ninth Month 14th, 1706.

My Dear Friend,

What I have heard from individuals was so great a surprise,
that my love questioned the integrity of those who related the sad story to me.
Has not thy soul felt immortality brought to light among us, with all our weaknesses,
beyond what thou ever felt among any other sort of people?
What strange eclipse is this?
It is like an apoplectic upon the mind.
Dear Thomas, look back, and look inward,
remember the days wherein we enjoyed sweet fellowship together in the heavenly power,
that has often filled the gospel temple, and been an agreeable odour among us.
I wish myself with thee, if but for a short time,
and if thou desires the company of any other friends to accompany me,
I will let them know.

Our fear, our love, our grief, weigh us down on thy account.
Dear Thomas, return by the door at which thou wentest out; and be a fool, a little child,
delighting thy soul in simplicity, meekness, and humility,
which the feeling of divine life brings into; wherein all doubts are resolved,
all fears are dispersed, and an entire sweetness, and content remains.
O what of this world is like unto this?
Our greatest joys take wings on a sudden,
and fly away, but the inward mental joys and comforts of the Holy Spirit,
they keep us company through this world to that which
is out of the reach of all earthly troubles,
and this is the reward of the righteous.

Be afraid of proceeding, and by this stumble thou wilt at last get ground to help others;
yea, the godly sorrow that may follow this hour and power of darkness,
in which thou art rather tried than overcome,
may produce a deeper sense and travail than ever; and restore, quicken,
and augment thy gift and service.
May it be so, saith my soul.
I write this in the innocency of my heart; make a right use of it,
and let me hear from thee, directed to H. G.

With true love to thee, and thy honest wife, I rest thy truly loving friend in the Lord,

William Penn.

From a letter of John Fothergill, to his Son, the late Dr. Fothergill, of London.

I Am preserved in usual health,
and attended with peace and comfort in our heavenly Father`'s goodness:
though in the appearance of a severe threatening time of distress, in divers respects,
to this nation: and if we be not excited hereby to diligence,
in seeking to lay hold of eternal treasure,
which is the love and favour of the fountain of all good,
we shall be more inexcusable than many others of mankind, who know not so well,
and clearly, where to seek for happiness, and a refuge indeed.

After this hint of what is much in mind,
I shall take notice of thy remarks on thy late journey into Holland and Germany;
and first say, thy account of divers people in those countries,
exactly agrees with my idea of them; for I believe they have had, in some measure,
their eyes opened, but they set man to work to form and imitate religion,
building without being enough concerned to find the rock.
Many, from their pious intentions, make a shew for a time, and some good may come of it:
but it is a matter to be lamented, that there should be, as it were,
a general propensity among the Germans to run away with speculation,
and thereby so many valuable springings, and glimpses of the heavenly day,
should have yet produced no more durable fruits,
as to the experiencing salvation in reality.
But it ever will be true,
that there is no following Christ acceptably without submitting to the cross.
Here seems to be the place at which the people of that country in particular,
as almost all nations in general, have suffered loss.
May the plough of God take more effectual hold amongst them, is my heart`'s desire;
and may this consideration strengthen thee in fearing to live and delight therein,
or be at ease in barren speculation, even of the best things or principles;
but be thou more and more animated to seek for daily
bread from the everlasting Father`'s hand,
who will hear and answer in due time, the patient, though hidden enquirers for it;
and thereby such will grow in the living root, and bear fruit to the Father`'s praise.

LETTER XLIl.

29th of Twelfth month 1783.

To +++_________+++,

Yesterday I received thine,
and found immediately so much sympathy with the state thou hast described,
and so much liberty to write thee, that I readily now undertake it,
though as I have already told thee, I have no correspondence of this kind;
but when permitted by the common Father of us all, we may then, if ever,
converse in this manner.

The state of poverty thou hast complained of has, alas, been my own many a long winter,
and that too attended with the most severe conflicts which
a stubborn nature and implacable enemy have made very bitter,
and even dangerous; but in times of the greatest peril, when on the brink of a precipice,
Infinite Mercy has condescended to interpose, and snatch the brand as out of the burning.

Thus much being premised may convince thee that thy case is by no means singular,
it being, I apprehend, the common lot of all those who undertake the spiritual travel,
to pass through deserts and suffer hunger and thirst,
till brought through into a land of plenty.
Thy state is now probably emerging from that of childhood,
in which the great and good Shepherd, who carries his lambs in his arms,
feeds them with divine spiritual food, even the milk of the word,
strengthening them to bear the cross he requires them to take up; but,
however pleasing this happy state may be, there must be a going forward,
even into the state of young men; witnessing some degree of strength,
and putting on armour, to resist the enemy of all good; and here it is,
when found faithful to the measure received,
we are favoured with some degree of stability,
so as to pass through the exercises allotted us with safety and comfort,
and to press still forward.

I need not now describe the dangers, the conflicts, and the assaults of the enemy,
who makes our own passions his tools to work with: sufficient it is to say,
that help is never wanting to those who depend on the source of all good,
in every trying season.

And now, my dear friend,
let me just point out the advantages of the state which seems hovering over thee.
In the first place it gives us to see clearly from whence are the several comforts,
deliverances, and mercies, which have attended us in our travel from the land of bondage,
in the wilderness state, and through the river Jordan (the river of judgment),
into the promised land,
where we have just begun perhaps to fight the inhabitants of the land (our own passions);
and having brought with us our memorials in our hands,
have been able to worship as at Bethel, the house of God.
Secondly,
it from hence teaches us where to apply for continual
help as we are in continual want of it,
some of the inhabitants having chariots of iron.
Thirdly, it teaches us that we have no strength of our own.
Fourthly,
it is a most evident means of humbling us under the
consideration that we have nothing that is good.
Fifthly,
we are hence led to value the more every instance of the Lord`'s goodness towards us,
thereby increasing our love and obedience,
and implicitly trusting to him by an increase of faith and
confidence that he will never leave nor forsake us.
Sixthly, this state may be compared to that of a tree, which in winter,
though it bear no fruit, gathers strength in taking deeper root;
so that in time of fruit, it may bear greater plenty,
and more pleasing to the good husbandman, as well as the beholders.
Lastly, the blessing is pronounced on those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
that they shall be filled: but whether this filling may be in time,
or when divested of the cumber of mortality, is known only to Him,
whose promises are Yea and Amen.
I am apt to think both here as well as hereafter to some --for, alas,
the lot of some is cast in a very barren land,
so that when one sees others favoured with the heavenly dew, one is ready to cry out,
that "`the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim is better than the vintage of Abiezer.`"
And yet one of the poor Abiezerites was made by the
Lord`'s power a notable deliverer of his people.
Thus, in every station, Omnipotence can raise up instruments to effect his purpose,
which is ever the good of his people, both generally as well as individually.
I might have added above, to the advantages of poverty,
that it greatly tends to bring down pride and self-conceit,
which must be laid in the dust.
There is also another advantage I have found in a very eminent degree,
and that is when plunged into the deepest poverty,
"`when the earth and its bars were about me,
so that not a glimpse of divine comfort was obtained for a long season,`" (I
hope this will not be thy case) the divine light so shone on all occasions,
that I never wanted directions for my conduct, even in ordinary affairs;
and so great was its lustre, that though I seemed confined to a very narrow path,
it was impossible to mistake without disobedience; which, alas,
was but too often the case, either through weakness, inattention, or sudden attacks;
and though sometimes I could not but fear, I was really dead: yet I concluded,
that dead men do not know it, consequently that was not my case; but poor,
very poor indeed, insomuch that I question if there ever was one more so.
Again, I was also convinced there was life,
because being favoured with light it evidently proved that the light came from the life,
for death always is attended with darkness.
And now, dear +++_________+++, do not be discouraged; be sure hold fast that thou hast,
never doubting that help is always near,
and that the Giver of every good and perfect gift,
knows and administers what is best for us; dwell, therefore, in the patience,
and let it have its perfect work.
If thou canst conveniently keep thy hour of retirement, it will be best,
and perhaps as near the same time of the day, for then the mind will look for it;
but if business of the family prevent, take it when thou canst.

I have written in haste, and in much love, in which I conclude

Thy very affectionate friend,

W+++.+++ P.

LETTER XLIII.

22nd of Third month 1788.

Being, contrary to my expectation and endeavours,
prevented from attending the ensuing monthly meeting at +++_________+++,
of which I was the more desirous,
for the same reason that I hoped and still hope thou wilt be there; I find freedom,
and that I trust after having maturely considered it with a desire to do right,
to communicate to thee what passed in my mind long
before I knew or expected that would have happened,
which prevents me.

It hath not been usual with me to think beforehand
of the affairs likely to come before such a meeting,
but the mention made by the friends of +++_________+++,
of the application of a certain person to be admitted a member of our Society,
occurred again and again to my mind,
and connected with it the parable of the leaven which
a woman hid in three measures of meal,
till the whole was leavened.
It was ' hidden,' but its operation, though secret, was gradual and progressive,
till there was a total assimilation;
'till the whole was leavened,' the process was from within to without;
the exterior part was the last affected, the last whose appearance was altered;
but though the last, it was as completely changed as the rest, the 'whole' was leavened.

This seemed to convey instruction to my own mind,
as setting forth the prior necessity of an inward change,
for the proper regulation of the outward deportment: I thought too,
it might be applied not improperly to the case, nor, perhaps,
unprofitably to the consideration of the party alluded to.
I do not doubt his having been sensible of the secret
influence of the divine principle in his own conscience,
or that his judgment has been measurably convinced
by the testimonies he has heard borne to the truth,
as professed by us as a people.
I as Utile doubt the sincerity of his desire to be
considered as one believing in the same principle,
and desirous to walk by the same rule.
But whether there is yet that thorough conviction,
that perfect harmony of faith and practice,
as would justify a conclusion that 'the whole' is leavened,
I hope he will not be offended if I recommend to his serious consideration,
rather than he should desire a premature admission;
for as he that believeth will not make haste, so a waiting for the right time,
when perfect unity will be experienced, will not retard his growth in the truth;
nor lessen the tender regard of his friends toward him, or the peace of his own mind.

I desire to be as brief as possible.
I have nothing but good-will in my heart towards him;
and if under the influence of that wisdom which alone, in such cases,
is profitable to direct, friends shall admit him a member of the society,
I shall freely give him the right hand of fellowship,
and desire to be his companion in the regeneration and in newness of life.

John Thorp.

LETTER XLIV.

8th of Seventh month 1787.

I Think I do as seldom as any man who wishes well to the cause of religion and virtue,
endeavour to recommend it by books,
though I do believe if people would read such as deserve reading, as thou says,
with a desire to profit, they would always reap some benefit by it.
My reading now, not only from necessity but judgment,
is pretty much confined with respect to all the forbidden
productions of the tree of knowledge.
I have seen a beauty and safety in that state of mind expressed by the Psalmist,
and earnestly have I desired to dwell in it:
"`Lord I do not exercise myself in things that are too high for me;
my soul is even as a weaned child.`"
The Scriptures without, and the law written in the heart,
are the most profitable of all books,
and in meditating on the divine precepts written there, with a desire to obey,
the most blessed knowledge is obtained.

John Thorp.

LETTER XLV.

15th of Eighth month 1787.

Do not think, dear friend, I am recommending books too highly;
every thing is good in its place; but I wish for thee as for myself,
and I believe it is so, that we may have in our possession the truth itself,
and that we may wait (that best of exercises) to feel,
(when it shall please him to replenish our hearts
with that light and virtue which comes from him),
the mysteries of his kingdom opened in ourselves.
The Lord Almighty is in great mercy, by various means, endeavouring to prepare us for,
and engage us to seek after these divine communications from the fountain itself,
wherein are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
Thus we should experience another sort of teaching and another kind of knowledge,
than that which books and outward instruction can furnish us with.
I long my dear friend,
that we may grow and increase in the knowledge and experience of that divine communication,
from the fountain of divine intelligence, and with one another in him,

LETTER XLVI.

22nd of Eleventh month 1787.

Honest Thomas a Kempis pleases me much.
I have always been pleased with it in any dress,
but I think this of Payne the most complete.
I know not that I have any thing to add,
perhaps it may convince thee thou art not the poorest man,
but of poverty I am not accustomed to complain.
I believe all the dispensations of Providence are right,
and so that we are but honest and faithful stewards of what we have received,
we shall not fail to be accepted; and this too, is the way to witness an increase:
let us then, dear friend, aspire after this, and rest satisfied with our own lot,
and with every allotment of Providence, doing every day whatever our hands find to do,
according to the present ability, with which let us ever be content.
Let us seek nothing for ourselves,
but that our blessed Master may be glorified in our obedience,
though it may be oftentimes through our own humiliation.

John Thorp.

LETTER XLVII.

15th of Eleventh month 1794.

Having the opportunity of conveying a few lines to thee, I was unwilling to let it slip,
and though I should have nothing to write worthy of much regard,
yet thou wilt at least be convinced of my good will,
and that if I had any thing better I should as freely have offered it.
I am not much in the practice of boasting of my infirmities,
and truly I have nothing else to boast of,
(I often think there is too much of this amongst us) and
yet lest thou should think of me above what I am,
I am free to tell thee that weakness and poverty are often my companions,
that jealousy and fear both night and day, do frequently attend me,
lest I should not be so improving my time and the talents committed to me,
as I ought to do;
lest I should not be so steadily preferring the things which are most excellent,
not enough setting my affections on things which are above,
and looking towards the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus;
lest obedience should not keep pace with knowledge, and the day`'s work with the day;
because I do see so clearly that the end of all things is at hand,
that the summer will soon be over, and the harvest ended.
Now if any thing like this should be also thy experience, I am not sorry for it;
but I do pray that this poverty, this weakness, this jealousy and fear may,
to both of us, be sanctified to our complete redemption.
Oh this great work,
redemption! if this be but happily accomplished in our experience
it matters very little what else is gained or lost.
I thought so through adorable mercy in my early youth,
when through the visitation of the day-spring from on high
a prospect was opened into things which are invisible,
the transcendent beauty of holiness was disclosed, and the glory of this world,
was stained in my view.
With what zeal and fervency was I then engaged to labour to obtain
an inheritance eternal in the heavens that fadeth not away;
and oh, the solicitude that I have and do now feel since I am advanced more in years,
that I might not survive the greenness of my youth, that I might not become more relaxed,
lukewarm, and indifferent, than I was in the day of mine espousals;
and indeed I can say to the glory of his name who lives forever,
that my love to God and to my brethren has not been on the decrease;
my soul was never more ravished with one of his looks,
with one chain of his neck whom my soul increasingly esteems the chiefest of ten thousand,
and altogether lovely; never, never had religion so many charms;
that I do many a time think when the vision of light is a little opened in my view,
that if never had before, I should not then, hesitate a moment,
but endeavour to give up all for eternal life.

Now, my dear friend,
that what I have wrote here is likewise descriptive of thy
religious situation I feel strongly disposed to believe,
and therefore it is in my heart to say, let us thank God and take courage;
let us lift up our heads in hope,
that he who has been our morning light will be our evening song:
and though in our progress through this wilderness we should meet with tribulation,
(for I have been instructed to believe) there is no outward situation exempt from trials;
but it is the privilege of the dependant children of our
heavenly Father that they know him to be their sanctuary.
This state of things is a compound of good and evil;
gall and worm-wood are deeply mingled in the cup we all have to drink,
though not perhaps in like proportion; but let us receive our respective portions,
as coming from his hand, who will make it a cup of blessing to his children.
We have the authority of holy writ to say, in all their afflictions he is afflicted,
and the angel of his presence is with them.
O what condescending language is this:
"`When thou passest through the waters I will be with thee,
and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee;
when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned,
neither shall the flame kindle upon thee.`"

Thus, whatever be the permitted dispensation of suffering
of any who love the Lord Jesus in sincerity,
however such may at seasons be divested of strength and clothed with sackcloth,
though such should have to pass through deep and fiery trials,
yet shall they be preserved; the Lord in whom they trust will be with all these,
will sanctify the dispensations, and in his own time bring deliverance;
will clothe with the strength of salvation,
will take off the sackcloth and clothe these with gladness,
so that for the encouragement of the upright and sincere,
whose hands I know are many times ready to hang down, yea to the whole Israel of God,
it may be said as formerly, "`There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun,
who rideth upon the heavens in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky;
the eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the everlasting arms.`"
I have written a longer letter than I expected,
in much freedom and more about myself than I ever did before that I remember,
but I will not pretend to make any apology for it,
some little instruction may at some time be derived from it.

John Thorp.

LETTER XLVIII.

15th of First month 1791.

There is, I believe, an obligation to duty above the fear of punishment,
or expectation of reward; and because I wish thee the most perfect state,
I wish thee this experience;
a state wherein all selfishness both in spiritual and temporal things is lost,
or swallowed up of divine universal disinterested love, as a drop of water in the ocean:
and though I do most assuredly believe that virtue is its own reward,
that a cup of cold water given to a disciple, in the name of a disciple,
shall not go without a reward;
yet I have often thought it a subject worth the consideration
of those who are stewards and desire to be faithful,
that this is neither the time nor place of rewards or punishments,
although the earnest of both are frequently felt.
I apprehend that many, even of the wise in heart, have been ready to stumble here,
thinking that their faithfulness and piety should have engaged the divine
interposition to exempt them from the sufferings of this present life;
so thought it is likely, the Roman Brutus, when,
overcome by Anthony in a cause wherein he thought virtue had engaged him,
with his latest breath he is said to have uttered this desponding exclamation,
"`Oh virtue, I have followed or worshipped thee as a substantial good,
but I find thee only an empty name.`"
How much of this sort appears in the book of Job,
whose trials were as singular and great as his conduct had been upright and approved!
And David tells us that his foot had well nigh slipped,
because he envied the prosperity of the wicked;
when he saw how they flourished as the green bay tree,
he was tempted to conclude that he had cleansed his
hands and washed himself in innocency in vain.

Time would fail to recount the sufferings, the trials,
and probations that have attended the peculiar heritage of God in all generations;
that their great privilege, it is plain,
hath ever been divine support and preservation under trials,
and not an exemption from them:
how great and various were the trials that attended the good old patriarchs,
and how singular and proving those that were experienced
by the man after God`'s own heart,
whose son even conspired to take away his life;
but he who is a God keeping covenant and mercy,
vouchsafed his protection and sure support, and was to him in all his troubles a rock,
a refuge, and a sure hiding place.
I feel beyond all that can be expressed in words for thee whilst I am writing,
that this may be thy happy experience, if trials of any sort be permitted to attend thee;
for though I know not how applicable or otherwise
any thing of this kind may be to thy present state,
yet this I know,
that there is no combination of outward circumstances can exempt us from trouble;
though we tread upon the high places of the earth, and dip our feet in oil:
but in the most proving situations, though some encouragement,
instruction and consolation may be derived from considering what hath been the lot,
and what the support of many elder brethren in the family,
who through many tribulations have entered the kingdom,
yet the most sovereign help and comfort is obtained by looking unto Jesus,
who was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief;
whose visage was more marred than any man, and his form more than the sons of men;
who being touched with a feeling of our infirmities, and having been tempted,
knows how to succour them who are tempted.
Let us then, my dear friend, in our varied allotments, lay aside every weight and burden,
and run with patience the race that is set before us,
looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith,
who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, and despised the shame,
and is set down at the right hand of the throne of God.
I would not make any unnecessary addition,
but I am so fully satisfied that it is not the will of our Father who is in heaven,
that any of his children should be discouraged under whatever
disadvantage in their own apprehension they may be placed,
or whatever cup they may have to drink, or baptism they may have to pass through;
but that they should be encouraged to put their trust in him,
to cast their care upon him; none who ever did so, ever were, or ever will be confounded.
Let nothing move us from this foundation, and we shall be safe.
Oh, how memorable is that saying of David, "`The Lord is my shepherd,
therefore I shall not lack;`" and again, "`Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me,
and thou art with me.`"
Thus in heights and depths, in seasons of trial and of rejoicing,
let our whole dependance,
our humble trust and confidence be in and upon the sure mercy of God in Christ Jesus,
and then I am sure that he will sanctify to thee all his dispensations;
that he will bless thee indeed,
and that as it hath pleased him to appoint thy lot as in a south land,
so he will continue as he hath in mercy hitherto at seasons done,
also to give thee springs of water, yea,
the sure inexhaustible springs of consolation that flow from his presence;
and this I wish for thee with as much sincerity, as for thy affectionate and true friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER XLIX.

22nd of First month 1793.

I have often of late felt something like the salutation
of love moving in my mind towards thee,
in which I wish thee both natural and spiritual health,
and as there is no medicine that can be prescribed or taken equal
to wholesome food and exercise for the preservation of bodily health,
so I believe that by this means our spiritual health also, is best preserved;
but we may observe some people as to the outward, whose constitution is not bad,
yet feeling some slight indisposition would rather have recourse to medicine,
or give themselves up to the feelings of their infirmities,
than employ the strength they have in necessary exercise,
and content themselves with such food as would be most profitable for them.
Something like this I apprehend to be the case with some religious persons,
who attending too much to every little feeling of weakness,
and comparing themselves with others,
whose gifts and callings may be very different from
theirs (though not at all more acceptable to God,
or according to his will) are ready to be discouraged,
and count themselves fit for nothing,
whereas the Lord is only glorified by our obedience
in that station in which he hath placed us,
so that let the sphere of our activity be what it may,
let the orbs in which we are placed be high or low, in human estimation,
let our gifts and callings be more or less conspicuous and admired by our fellow pilgrims,
those who are faithful and honest in their varied allotments,
seeking nothing for themselves,
but to bring glory unto God by a life of humble dedication to him; these,
however they may have been regarded amongst men,
or however at times they may be ready to judge of themselves,
will finally meet with an equal welcome from the blessed Master,
as approved good and faithful servants.
Oh, how wisely then do they act, who taking no anxious thought for to-morrow,
are attentive according to present ability, to the duties of the present day;
who satisfied with their own allotment of suffering, of exercise, of consolation,
and labour, cheerfully comply with the divine appointment;
these neither desire more or fewer talents than what they have received,
but wisely occupying with these, experience an improvement.

I hardly know how to put into words what I have in view to recommend,
and what I am favoured at seasons to see is the most excellent way, though possibly,
my dear friend, thou art much more advanced in this way than I am.
It is to be careful for nothing,
but in every thing by prayer and supplication let our wants be made known unto God,
casting all our care upon him who careth for us, to cast off every weight and burden,
and run with patience the race that is set before us,
doing with our might whatever our hands find to do;
but what meaneth this language we so often hear, and so often feel?
I can do nothing,--I have no ability,--I have neither strength nor understanding;
and in whose heart hath this language been raised more feelingly than in my own,
for who is so deaf,
or so blind as the servants or messengers of the
Most High when his light is not with them?
But when he who increaseth strength to them who have no might of their own,
who speaketh to things that are not, as though they were, and they obey him;
when in gracious condescension he is pleased to call,
to move to any little service amongst our brethren,
let us not then complain of want of ability, nor reason upon our unfitness:
remember it was through faith the walls of Jericho fell down,
but the ram`'s-horns were employed as instruments.
Oh this faith to which all things are possible, which removes mountains,
and in which we should walk; without which it is impossible to please God;
let us contend for it, let us watch unto prayer that it may be increased,
for by this shall all the fiery darts of the enemy be quenched.
I know that Jesus is the author of this faith;
I know it is the faith of the operation of God;
but yet I am verily persuaded that by standing open,
and willingly yielding to this operation,
or turning away and shutting our minds against it,
we shall experience an increase or diminution of it.
Abraham believed God (against all human probability) and it was counted to him,
said the apostle, for righteousness.
Lord, be it unto me, according to thy word, said the holy virgin Mary:
thus prepared she conceived the Redeemer of mankind.
Have faith in God, said the ever blessed Jesus to his disciples; and to Thomas,
be not faithless, but believing:--said I not unto thee,
was the answer of our blessed Lord unto Martha,
that if thou wouldest believe thou shouldest see the glory of God?

It is not in my heart, very far from it,
to put any upon moving in the Lord`'s service in their own will, or their own time,
but I want to recommend to thee, my dear friend, what I feel to be necessary for myself,
an unreserved dedication of heart to God,
a careful abiding with and attention to the blessed Master;
it is in my heart to say to thee, whatsoever he saith unto thee do it;
no man by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature.
I would have you, said the apostle, to be without carefulness;
let us leave every thing to him who hath all power; let us commit ourselves and our all,
our children, who are dear to us as our own lives, unto the Bishop of Souls,
who loves and careth for them more than we do; who, blessed be his holy name,
saith all that is within me, hath not only died for us, but for our children.
Oh, that they also may be made willing to die to themselves, that they might live to him!

In the fresh feeling of the heavenly Father`'s love, of which I am no ways worthy,
I salute thee as a brother in Christ, and commend us both unto his holy keeping.

Remember me affectionately to thy wife, whose dwelling is, I trust,
secure in the valley of humility.

John Thorp.

LETTER L.

26th of Fourth month 1796.

It is now more than twelve months since I received thy kind letter,
though there has not passed one month, perhaps not one day,
in which I have not affectionately remembered thee;
and thou would long since have had a reply to it,
if I had thought thou had stood in need of any instruction, or help from me.
If the enemy has gained any advantage by my silence, either against thee or me,
I am sorry for it;
but I believe thou hast been too long acquainted
with his devices to be in much danger from that quarter.

The very poor account thou condescended to write me of thy own situation,
did not at all surprise me; it was just such a one as I should have expected from thee;
the happy humble state of thy mind,
added to its great sensibility under the humiliating gradual process of regeneration,
disposeth to such feelings and such fears.
I believe there are many of us,
were it not that we are sometimes favoured for the sake of others,
should have much the same account to give of ourselves.
Thou may be sure enough my dear friend,
that if Providence seeth meet to make any other use
of thee than that which he hath long done,
as a preacher of righteousness in life and conversation, as a father to the poor,
and a succourer of many,
when the right time shall come thou wilt not be left in any doubt about it;
but if otherwise, it is all right,
it is enough if we are found faithful stewards in
the station which the Master hath appointed us,
whether as stewards of grace, or of the things of this life.
What cause have we not only to be satisfied with, but thankful for our lots?
Our outward circumstances, our mental powers, and spiritual gifts,
are diversified by him who only is wise,
and it is deeply fixed as a sentiment in my mind, that the allotment,
or gifts of each individual of us, if we act well our part,
and are faithful in the improvement,
will conduce more completely to fill up the measure of our happiness through all eternity,
than any varied portion could possibly do.
The great point by which glory, honour, and peace, both here and forever,
would certainly be gained, is, for each of us to stand in our own lots,
resigned to the will of God in all the varied dispensations of his providence,
seeking no more of either prosperity or adversity, of poverty or riches,
of suffering or rejoicing, in things spiritual or temporal,
than he knows to be best for us.

I note all that thou hast hinted of some circumstances, which as a parent,
do furnish for thee some degree of affliction; experience hath taught me to sympathize,
in a case which, though somewhat dissimilar, hath been to me exceedingly distressing;
but, my dear friend, what can we do for them?
Nothing of ourselves, to be sure, that will do any good, but, through divine help,
we can love, pity, and pray for them; and indeed with some,
this is the last and only resource; and O, the fear that I have felt,
lest I should be deficient here.

The fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much;
let us be found diligent in this holy exercise:
the example of Job is worthy our imitation,
and with what fervency did the father of the faithful
address the Most high with this petition:
"`O that Ishmael might live before thee!`"
God forbid, said the prophet Samuel, concerning the rebellious house of Israel,
that I should sin against the Lord, in ceasing to pray for you.
O that both thou and I may be found fervent enough, and frequent, in this great duty,
often retiring to the closet of our hearts, the temple which God hath chosen,
and there to pour forth our supplications to our Father who is in heaven,
that he would take our children under his care.
Much benefit would arise from this practice.

I am very far from thinking thee a stranger to this Christian exercise;
for any thing I know thou mayest have gone far beyond me in the practice; if so,
permit me to recommend it to thee to persevere,
and for thy encouragement let us remember the example of the woman who came to Christ,
and would not be denied, Matt. 15:22, and likewise the parable of our blessed Lord,
by which he taught that men should always pray, and not faint.
Luke xviii.
O,
the consolation and support we also should derive
from thus spreading our cause before the Lord,
and committing ourselves, our children, and our all into his hands,
who is the Shepherd and Bishop of soul.

Wishing thee every comfort, and every blessing, consistent with the Divine will,

I remain thy affectionate and sincere friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER LI.

2nd of Second month 1798.

Though I have not written to thee now of a long time,
it would be great injustice to suppose I had forgot thee;
I do not even suspect thee on the same account, and I am not willing to be suspected,
I remember thee often, my dear friend, I believe in the manner thou would wish me,
according to ability and strength afforded,
and I have the comfort also to believe thou art graciously remembered of God; yet,
like a wise and tender father,
he knoweth how to preserve his people humble and in a state of deep abasement before him,
because he knoweth, who knoweth all things, that it is best and safest for us.
I have, indeed, often observed with humble admiration,
the unfailing wisdom of his discipline in this respect;
always increasing with all his gifts and favours, our humble abasement before him.
Seeing in the light the necessity of this, I have often fervently petitioned for it,
and though painful apprehensions and many fears do
generally attend a state of spiritual desertion,
as if it was some way or other our own fault,
and the consequence of some impropriety of conduct, yet,
as the eye is kept single to him in submission,
and the hunger and thirst after his righteousness maintained, such shall at seasons,
when it pleaseth him,
and most certainly when their days of mourning and conflict here are over,
be for ever filled and clothed with it;
so that I believe the Lord would have us to be encouraged to press forward,
keeping the mark in view: "`Be not weary in well-doing,
in due season ye shall reap if ye faint not.`"
Nothing hath happened to us, but such things as are common to our fellow pilgrims;
though I know the enemy tells a clean contrary story, and would have us to believe,
that our case and lot is harder and worse than hath fallen to the share of any other;
but no credit must be given to him, who was a liar from the beginning,
and who always seeks to cast down those whom he cannot exalt
above measure.--But thou art not ignorant of his devices;
the good soldier, thou knowest, must endure hardness;
and let us always remember him of whom the prophet spake, that he was a man of sorrows,
and acquainted with grief;
and can we expect to get to heaven without passing through a similar process?

Thou and I have now been long engaged in the Christian warfare,
I humbly trust not altogether unsuccessfully,
we can be at no great distance from the end of the Christian race;
the crown is at the end of it,
laid up for and shall be given to those who love the appearing of the Lord,
the righteous judge; which I have no doubt is thy case;
I pray that it may evermore be mine.

Give my love to thy wife,
who I believe hath made great progress in that way that will end in peace.
O how I long,
how I wish to encourage all my fellow pilgrims to persevere in the high way to the kingdom,
and in an especial manner such at have been long on their journey,
and are at no great distance from the heavenly country,
that the strength of all such may be so renewed, that they may run without being weary,
that they may walk and not faint.

John Thorp.

LETTER LII.

28th of Tenth month 1799.

Many a time of late have I thought I would write to thee,
and I certainly should before now,
if I had not felt myself so almost constantly unfit for any sort of communication,
through somewhat of an uncommon degree of what we call spiritual poverty.
I do not say this in a way of complaint, I have no doubt it is all in wisdom.
I do not even wish the dispensation to be changed before the time.
I have no cause to believe I am alone in this condition,
though as to the degree I am sometimes ready to think so;
I do not only feel so destitute of spiritual enjoyments,
but of ability to do any thing to help myself,
so that although I have been endeavouring after spiritual attainments,
now for more than forty years, yet, when I sit down in meetings,
in a stripped state to a degree of nakedness, I know no more how to help myself,
than when I was a little child; sometimes as my mind sinks into submission,
I am permitted to possess a little quietness and peace, and sometimes,
for causes that I do not so clearly know, I experience considerable conflict;
but as I said before, I have no doubt but this is all in mercy.
I know him in whom I have I have believed,
and my soul desires to bow in submission to all his dispensations.

It is very unusual for me to speak or write so much about myself,
and I do not know how I came to do it now, unless it be to convince thee,
if thou also should sometimes pass through seasons of deep humiliation and abasement,
that thou art not indeed the poorest of the spiritual family; nay,
if thou was to think thy case was not at all to be compared to others,
I myself have thought so too; how often have I been ready to say, Yes,
these good people may have to pass through these baptisms,
perhaps for their further purification,
or it may be to enable them to speak more feelingly to others; but what is that to me?
I have reason to fear mine is rather a state than a baptism,
and proceeds from the unregenerate condition of my own heart:
what else can be the reason why I am so insensible of good,
and sit meeting after meeting as the parched heath in the desert; nay,
even when testimonies are borne I am like the deaf adder.
Thus many a time, in years that are now past,
hath my poor mind been tossed as with a tempest, and not comforted,
and thus at seasons am I permitted in measure to be exercised to this day:
many a time have I said in my heart, Lord,
if these dispensations are intended to make me feel what I am without thee,
and that of myself I can do nothing; that there is none good but one,
and that is God--if to convince me of this be thy gracious purpose, surely it is enough;
I am full of this conviction;
notwithstanding when I consider what the ever blessed Master suffered for us,
when he trod the wine-press alone, and gave his life a ransom for many,
I am even ashamed to think any thing of what we meet with, of the nature of suffering,
in our daily Christian warfare.
No, my dear friend, let us rather glory in tribulations also:
inasmuch as we are made thereby the more conformable to his blessed example,
who as a man of sorrow, and acquainted with grief.

I have just now, since writing the above, given thy last kind Christian letter,
dated 9th month, 1798, a fresh reading,
of which I do not know that I have much to remark,
except that thou thinkest too ill of thyself, and too well of me;
in both respects perhaps this letter may help to set thee right.
Of the subject of human infirmities,
I once heard (and I thought it did me good) a truly
living humble minister of the gospel say,
that though he could not say he loved the Lord his God with all his heart,
and his neighbour as himself; he could, or durst say this,
that he had not left off striving to arrive at that attainment.
Let us then keep up the warfare as good soldiers of Christ: and O,
let us be careful and diligent in this important business:
do not let the world have too much of our time, or attention;
we at our time of life must very soon leave it.
Be encouraged, my dear friend, to persevere in the Christian warfare against the world,
the flesh, and the devil: occupy with the talents received; attend to thy stewardship,
both of grace and the things of this life;
do all the good the blessed Master bids thee do, both to the souls and bodies of men:
and then, never fear, when the day of reckoning shall come,
thou shalt receive the answer of "`Well done, good and faithful servant,
enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.`"
Let us number our mercies, and commemorate the many favours, preservations,
and deliverances that have been hitherto vouchsafed unto us;
and bless the name of him who lives for ever,
for what he hath given and for all he hath denied;
and when his fatherly corrections and chastisements may be exercised upon us,
those certain evidences of filiation, O, that we may be enabled, in feeling submission,
to kiss the rod;
thus would all the gracious designs of our heavenly Father be accomplished,
and all his dispensations would be sanctified unto us.

I am thy affectionate friend,

John Thorp.

LETTER LIII.

Plymouth, 22nd of First month 1747.

Dear Friend, M. W.

In a measure of the divine life and fellowship of the Gospel I tenderly salute thee,
and I choose the present time as thou art brought very fresh to my remembrance,
as thou hast indeed many times been,
especially about the close of my last Cornish journey; for as in the course of it,
and in the services to which I was called,
I witnessed the Lord`'s supporting arm to be near me,
so was my mind frequently tendered and raised into a living sense of the unbounded
goodness and wonderful condescension of our great master to his poor servants,
who are labouring to be nothing in themselves; empty vessels; that He may be all,
and they what he pleases to make them.
The exaltation they are seeking after is the being raised
from death to fulness of life by virtue of his divine power,
and that in and by its mighty working in them,
that they may be made instruments effectual to extend
its dominion in the hearts of their fellow mortals.
In a sense of these things I am engaged to call encouragingly to thee.
What signifies all the opposition that men can make to the work of God?
They may endeavour to the utmost of their power and the depth of
their craft either to suppress or undermine this work,
but all in vain; for he that sits in heaven shall laugh them to scorn,
and when he sees meet shall scatter them as the driven stubble,
and pour contempt upon them.
In the mean time it is our prudence to be still, having our eye only to our Leader,
and not fret too much because of evil doers;
for as we are in the discharge of our duty all will be well with us;
and though there may be baptizing times of deep suffering with the oppressed seed,
as well as hard work to get into our services through the opposition of dark spirits,
yet as we are kept in innocence and uprightness toward God, and so out of condemnation,
I think all this may be cheerfully borne for the sake of that peace and divine
sweetness wherewith he is often pleased to season and overshadow our spirits;
for which cause my advice to thee is to move strait forward,
without looking behind or about thee,
having found much thoughtfulness is very weakening and frequently
made use of by the enemy to hurry and deject us,
whereas were we cheerfully to undergo the suffering we are called to,
it would be much easier to be gone through than when the
difficulty is increased by our own uneasy reflections.
Let me therefore once more speak encouragingly to thee, and say, never mind the opposers,
but follow thy engagements simply and fear no consequences,
for nothing but good can be the consequence of sincere obedience.

And in regard to the sense we have of our own weakness and unworthiness as creatures,
let us consider how much we have already seen of the all sufficiency of his powerful arm,
which we have had a full evidence hath been stretched out for our help.
Have we not seen his wonders in the deep?
And why then should we doubt his love towards us?
He can use what instruments he pleases, and as it has pleased him to make use of us,
let us not suffer the enemy to' perplex our minds about our own unworthiness and unfitness;
it is his power and holy unction that is the only qualification for his work,
and as he is pleased to dispense this,
let us be satisfied and never mind how mean we ourselves are;
for let us be low as we may,
the highest among mortals is as low in his eye before whom all nations
are as the drop of the bucket or the small dust of the balance.

I am sensible that at times we are in great want, and leanness comes over us;
but I have found that as our eye is to the Lord (though he may see meet to try
us with want of bread) he supports under the hunger to which the blessing is,
helping us through the dark stormy days and times of famine;
blessing the little he is pleased to give, and making it sufficient for our sup port,
and to keep us alive till he sends rain on the land;
and thus is this (though the sorest of all exercises) made tolerable,
as we keep in the faith and patience of the saints;
and nothing embitters it so much as letting in consultations and reasonings.

Thus, my dear friend, have I found tilings, and thus do?
with much simplicity mention them: thy experience I am sensible, in many things,
far exceeds mine,
yet perhaps thou mayst catch a little light from some part of this letter,
which is written from no other motive but love.

LETTER LIV.

I have thus far, as thy sympathizing friend,
suggested every thing that occurs to me which might be of use in in thy disorder;
but the great medicine from above, the sacred balm, the Almighty,
and unerring hand of divine mercy,
is the only certain cure or alleviation of the sufferings and ills
attending poor pilgrims in their travel through this vale of tears.
What happiness is it to be in possession of this knowledge?
Long hast thou been in possession of it;
long hast thou looked to the 'God of Jacob as thy strength,
and he hath owned thee in thy own heart by lifting
up the light of his countenance upon thee,
and by being thy present help in every needful time,
and to those of thy acquaintance who know and love him,
hast thou been truly near and honourable.

My heart embraces thee whilst I write,
in the love which stretches beyond the narrow bounds of time,
and is immortal in the root; and claimeth kindred with every child of the family of God.
Many such claims hath my soul in particular on eternity, or life would be an insipid way,
a bitter thing to me.

Genuine friendship is a plant from heaven;
it bears the most pleasant fruit we taste below;
but it is eternity must exalt this fruit to its highest flavour.
Love, the badge, the employment,
and delight of the real disciple and true child of Christ, is, and must be,
its own everlasting reward.

I lost a father very young, but he who hath been a tender father to me,
left me to honour his memory.
Dear sisters, of good dispositions, have been removed.
A loving, worthy and dearly beloved wife, the desire of mine eyes,
was taken from me by a stroke.
My very dear friend, thy brother, was called home in the strength of life.
My tender mother, dear to me by the natural tie, but inexpressibly so as a friend,
her too have I lost in the language of men.
But are all these souls lost?
I trust not.
For I cannot bear the thought:
let me but continue to labour to know him "`Who is the resurrection and the life,`"
to preserve and cultivate that life which he in infinite mercy has raised in me,
and I have no doubt, but I shall rejoin them and never be separated from them, more;
for well am I assured, that true friendship survives the grave.

Thou wilt from what I have wrote, judge of my mind in regard to thee.
Grave advices to one who hath endeavoured to live by supreme direction,
would be nauseously impertinent, and consolation unnecessary,
further than the overflowings of a friendly heart,
ready to join him who sucks at the everlasting breasts.
Calmly therefore, warm at heart, with brotherly love,
with hopes full of immortality for thee, and for myself,
I dearly salute thee and thy spouse, remaining Thy affectionate friend,

W+++.+++ C

LETTER LV.

To S. Taylor, of Manchester.

Dudley, 4th of Second month 1753.

Dear Friend,

Considering the contents of thy last acceptable favour,
I think thou might reasonably have expected a return ere now;
but thou well knowest every body has not the command of their pens at all times,
so I hope thou hast suspended passing judgment on my long silence.
I am conscious to myself of my friendship for thee, as well as convinced of thine for me,
which I hope will be lasting as our lives, nay will not terminate with time;
for as it is constituted by the unchangeable truth,
we must one of us depart from that before the fellowship can be broken,
which I earnestly pray may never be our unhappy lots;
for it had been better for us never to have been
made partakers of the power of the world to come,
than for us to fall from the knowledge and grace received;
but I have no fears on this hand on thy account,
although I well know temptations and dangers attend thee, as well as poor me; but thou,
by a longer experience, art, I believe, better armed against them,
and more quick in discerning the secret attacks of the enemy.

Do not think I flatter, for I speak truly when I say, I am but a child, a mere infant,
in the experimental part of religion;
however favoured at times in the sight of the people,
all which I think I would cheerfully resign to witness
a growth in the root of eternal life;
it being that only which will gain the approbation
of him who judges not by outward appearances,
but looks at the heart.

O the necessity of a continual watchfulness, and holy awe, to walk before him blameless:
my soul is distressed under the consideration of it,
lest those who set out later should get before me in this heavenly race:
thou wouldst perhaps tell me my fears were groundless, but, my dear friend,
couldst thou discern the fluctuations of my mind, the various turns of the passions,
the barrenness of my spirit, and how it wanders from the centre of its strength,
thou wouldst acknowledge there was cause to fear and tremble;
for my standing seems to be very precarious.

O talk no more, I beseech thee, of my stability, watchfulness, and readiness,
to perform the duties required.
If I have been assisted to do any little service for my God, to him belongs the glory.
I wish I was more worthy of his favours;
but am too sensible of my deficiencies to receive any part of the praise.
However,
I hope to press forward towards the mark of the prize
of the high calling in Christ Jesus:
which I apprehend to be a constant and entire submission
to the will of our heavenly Father,
whether it be in doing or suffering: this is the happy, humble,
yet exalted state my soul at times pants after,
and longs to make a sacrifice of the esteem of those who are in the spirit of the world,
to whom let me be unknown and had in derision,
so that I may but enjoy that fellowship with the
saints which stands in communion with the Father,
Son, and Holy Ghost.

My dear friend, I hope thy excuse for these incorrect hints: thou mayst observe, by them,
the labour of my soul, which I am unexpectedly led to communicate;
(though I do it but seldom) but I know to whom I am writing, and give liberty to my pen.
I am much better in health than when I wrote thee last.
I then was ready to conclude myself like a ship that stood fair for the harbour,
but am now tossed back on the dangerous ocean of life,
destined to endure a longer contest with the storms, etc. attending the passage over it.

Well be it so, I will not say it was an adverse wind that blew me back;
doubtless my vessel was not richly enough laden to enter the celestial port,
and its being continued longer at sea, was intended that I might add to its burthen.
O that this grace may not be bestowed in vain:
but may I use all diligence to make good the voyage,
that I may happily land safe at last on the shore of endless felicity.

My mother is brave and well, and with my sister unites in dear love to thee;
in the same I desire to be remembered to thy brother and friends at Manchester:
it is late, and time to bid thee farewell, which I do as much as I am capable,
in the gospel, and with great sincerity, subscribe myself, thy affectionate friend,

Catherine Payton.

LETTER LVI.

Bury, (Suffolk) 30th of First month 1768.

Dear Friend,

It is with great nearness and satisfaction that I
remember my particular friends in Pennsylvania,
amongst whom thou art often brought to my remembrance,
and if strength of desire could have sympathetically affected thy heart,
I should have had some little stream through thy quill,
which when in hand is not slow to move on pleasing subjects.
I consider thy situation at present, and make no doubt but thou art often deeply bowed,
and tenderly engaged,
to implore strength and clear understanding to discharge thyself honestly,
and to keep a conscience void of offence both towards God and man.
I have often thought that such men, who see themselves in the true light,
and are careful to dwell therein, their eye being single to the glory of God,
their whole body is full of light,
every sense and faculty being thereby quickened and enlivened: such men, I say,
see their gifts, and know to use them both in church and state,
and are thereto constrained for the Lord`'s sake,
which is the true spring that gives perfect motion to every duty,
and preserves the whole in harmonious order.

When we, under proper influence, have discharged ourselves,
sometimes applause will shine on us, and self (with the unstable multitude),
will tempt us to take a view with the help of his spectacles,
that gifts and qualifications may be admired.
This snare, seen and avoided, perhaps self will turn, to discourage from duty,
and breathe such a carping mist, that it will seem to darken the very air round about,
and then we cannot judge perfectly.
We are all servants, and it is good for us to despatch the business,
do our Master`'s errand, and return home quickly,
not to play in the sunshine of applause.
Neither tarry from home in the night.
Our Master tabernacles in the clean heart: if we dwell there,
we shall see our business by his light; and when he is pleased to move or send,
the light goeth before, and will last, until the errand be performed.
Dear friend, I am thankful on thy behalf,
because I fully believe thou well knowest the meaning of the above hints,
and that in the Lord alone is our peace, rest, and refreshment.

Oh! the value of deep retirement, and even sometimes a cessation of all thinking,
that we may be renewed in a right way of thinking,
and our enfeebled spirits strengthened and enabled to run the Christian race,
hold out to the end in well doing, and obtain the reward of eternal life;
which that we may receive is the earnest breathing of my soul.

I had to look on Pennsylvania, and was made to admire her goodly situation,
the privileges that her inhabitants enjoy.
May the people humble themselves, and walk worthy the blessings of heaven,
even respecting the state: which if they do, I make no doubt but the Lord will raise up,
and qualify men to take on them the care and concern for the whole,
with which some worthies were clothed, that are now removed.
And, in remembering the church,
when I have beheld the ruinous plight of her walls and discipline in this nation,
I have been ready to say, her King is in the midst,
and the law is received from his mouth.

May the aged bow their heads, and worship before the Lord;
the middle aged keep humble under his fear, observing his teaching;
that the places of the elders may be filled, who are removed from amongst us;
and that the Lord may continue to pour forth of his spirit and anointing on our offspring,
to the latest generation.

I did intend to have written historically, but must refer thee to thy dear brother,
who still continues with me an agreeable companion; shall therefore, with dear love,
conclude thy real friend,

John Churchman.

LETTER LVII.

Ware, 23rd of 2nd month, 1747.

My Dear Friend,

Herewith I send thee a few sheets intended to prove, that scripture knowledge,
without Divine aid, is insufficient to conduct a Christian safely on his way;
for mankind since the fall, and the consequent degeneracy,
have for the most part centered in a wretched neglect
and ignorance of their real duty to the Creator.
And although no duty is more emphatically pressed upon those who profess
to own and revere the mission and messiahship of the Son of God,
than that of loving the Divinity with the most pure and generous affection (even
in that which they deem their rule) yet that being of itself a dead letter,
and unable without fresh participations of life and virtue,
from a living and energetic principle,
to inspire or furnish the creature either with sensations of,
or faculties for the perception or performance of so sublime a duty,
and so opposite to their natural tastes,
they have generally beheld the precepts relative
thereto with superficial and fallacious views;
so that although they have gathered from the letter apprehensions of other duties,
as worship, etc. yet that of Divine love hath remained too much discarded,
or at least disregarded by them.

Yet blessed be the Father and fountain of love and consolations,
through the several series of time,
he hath been graciously pleased to discover himself to a remnant,
who by the lively influence and manifestation of
divine favour have been led to love him again.
And although perhaps they may not have a distinct
discursive and explicit knowledge of some truths,
yet the sincerity of their love and affection, the product of the Divine principle,
hath ever been acceptable.
And He, who ever remains diffusive and bountiful in communications to his creatures,
is now, through the emanations of his divine light and life,
imparting to his little ones, his waiting, dependent, and debased children,
glorious discoveries of himself,
and vouchsafing to reveal those mysteries which have
been hid for ages from the wise and prudent,
even to babes and sucklings; no doubt for this great and glorious purpose, that by them,
in his own time and way, his praise may be perfected.

The doctrine of the internal and immediate revelation of Divine light and life,
(which we profess) operating by love (and productive in the soul resigned
to its influence and guidance of a proper love to the Creator,
and to the creature for his sake) is the most noble and
beneficent sentiment that ever mankind was blest with.
It is this, as it comes to have a rightful pre-eminence in the world,
and prevalence over the mind, which alone would regulate all disorders,
by subjecting all to the will and order of the Creator.
It would demonstrate to the devoted soul, the impossibility of loving God too much,
or of denying ourselves of too much for his sake,
who denied himself of so much for our sake,
by humbling himself and becoming subject to the shame and death of the cross;
condescending to dignify the meanest of mortals with invaluable blessings.
It would teach us to renounce the most secret acts
of infidelity and dishonesty towards Him,
and to abandon the most harmless gratifications of self and nature,
when they tended to obstruct and retard that state of abstraction and purification,
necessary to the discipleship of love.
It would perfect in us, the divine and moral virtues,
and qualify to answer every purpose of civil and religious society,
of which it would make us bright and useful members, and lead into every particular duty,
which either convictions in ourselves,
or the precept and example of good and faithful men,
might shew to be agreeable to the divine will.
It would renew the face of the church; array Zion in beautiful garments,
render her fair as Jerusalem, "`comely as Tirzah,
terrible (for her power and strength) as an army with banners.`"
It would invest hoary heads with crowns of glory,
and induce our youth to a strict and religious emulation of the virtues of their ancestors,
and in our faithfulness, replenish each particular with that sensation and enjoyment,
which infinitely surpasseth the conception of natural powers.

This alone can support in the most depressing and calamitous of human circumstances,
by favouring with the hope,
that nothing (however trying) shall ever be able to separate us
from the principal object of the soul`'s desire and affection;
a fear which awaits and frequently allays the most
joyous and delectable of human prospects and grandeurs.
That this Divine principle may have its proper scope and influence,
in thy tender and favoured breast, is my sincere desire,
and the design of my submitting these mean and unpolished papers to thy perusal;
and may thy breathings, as thou finds access, be on my behalf,
that while I am led to press these truths on others,
I myself may not become a cast away therefrom; but in holy travail,
and united exercise of spirit, may we approach the house of God,
and ascend his holy mountain Sion, his sanctuary, from whence "`his law shall go forth,
and his blessing be commanded, even life for evermore.`"

I am thy friend, with true regard,

Samuel Scott.

LETTER LVIII.

Ware, 3rd of Second month 1750.
Esteemed Friend,

Thankfulness attends my mind at this time,
that I am sensible there is a love infinitely than all the powers of death and hell,
and a divine fellowship which no mutable accidents can impair,
neither time nor space interrupt:
for as it subsists alone by the power of an endless commandment,
so it is only maintained in the circulation of the blood of an everlasting covenant,
and enjoyed in its greatest strength and glory,
in the absence and deprivation of all visible and external objects;
in the entire silence of mental representations and introversion
of spirit towards the Fountain of life and blessedness.

O, my friend, let us labour more and more to cease from all that is visible and external,
and gather to the life of Jesus, the unchangeable foundation,
the standard lifted up to all nations, and the day-spring which hath visited our souls;
for herein the quickened travelling exercised members of the church,
when under a total incapacity of personal communion
are one another`'s strength and joy 4n the Lord.
Here they receive the efficacy of the atonement made
by their holy head in the day of his humiliation;
the evidences of divine approbation, and a holy consolation.
And now, my friend, I may just signify,
that since I have been prevented having personal intercourse with thee,
I have been favoured at times to have thee in living remembrance,
and have rejoiced to feel thy soul (in a secret, invisible,
but very lively manner) in a holy travel towards the Father of life.
As to mine own particular, since we last met,
I have not only experienced the close besiegings and bondage of the spirit of darkness,
and the contumelies and reproach of some of my fellow mortals,
who are taking their repose in external peace and affluence, unacquainted with the pangs,
pressures, and probations of an afflicted seed;
but likewise the kind interpositions of Almighty help and preservation.
O, we are some of us the monuments of an unspeakable and inconceivable mercy; and,
although it hath been a day of inward and outward reproach and darkness,
yet I may say for thy encouragement, that of late, at times,
the light of Zion hath shined upon me in brightness.

A degree of gratitude at this time fills my heart, and in that I would just say, O come,
let us walk in the light.
I request thy company and help of thy spirit in a
close engagement in the way and work of the Lord;
and conclude thy sincere friend,

Samuel Scott.

P+++.+++ S. The poetical pieces thou wilt receive herewith, are the productions of one, who,
notwithstanding the soothing allurements of youth,
and a competent share of natural and acquired endowments,
is led to behold the wretched vanity and emptiness of all created beings,
to look upon Zion, and desire her beauty.
He reposes so great a confidence in thee, as to submit them to thy perusal,
with this restriction, that no copies may be taken therefrom.

LETTER LIX.

16th of Second month 1753.

Esteemed Friend,

I was sorry that I had not an opportunity of once more personally taking my leave of you:
but the floods of death, as mighty waters, seem to have overflowed my soul,
and rendered me incapable of performing those acts of religion
and friendship due to my Creator and my fellow-creatures.
The usual assignment of the dead, is to be cast forth from amongst the living,
because of the inutility and obnoxiousness of their condition.
The countenance and presence of the Divinity alone,
imparts life and beauty to the creature, and how can one cut off therefrom,
covet the notice and observation of mortals,
but rather a lodging place in the wilderness, or a retreat in the desert?
I am clothed with sackcloth,
I have pitched my tent for a season at the gates of mourning;
expecting at times an invisible archer will ere long separate me for ever from the living.
But while I bemoan the bitterness of such a state,
methinks I see the generality of those around me
replete with sentiments of peace and gaiety,
though subjected to the same captivity.
All the children of Adam are, by the decree of Omnipotence,
separated from the life and favour of the Holy One,
and eternally barred from access thereto by any means,
but the influence and spirit of the Mediator, and as they abide in him,
who is their peace and atonement.
This light shineth and enlighteneth every man; but O,
how few endure the fire of the sanctuary,
which he ordaineth to burn with a perpetual flame,
or persevere steadfastly in the paths which he prepareth in strait places!
Was such a submission experienced, how would our woes cease,
our captivity be swallowed up of life,
and the garments of mourning be exchanged for praise
I The children of light would then rejoice together,
and the church, militant and triumphant, unite in adoration of Him,
who is perfect in beauty, and infinite in goodness.
Hereto have we been called with a call from heaven;
but when we consider how we have swerved therefrom, tears fill our eyes,
and heaviness our hearts.
In the absence of the bridegroom, the children of the bride chamber cannot but mourn;
nevertheless, dear friend, though we sorrow, let it not be without hope; and if we mourn,
let it be with the utmost privacy, and discretion.
The bridegroom of souls is the resurrection and the life; He can breathe on bones,
whose energy is departed from them; give beauty for ashes,
and fill the dust of the grave with the fragrance of the morning.

These broken and unconnected expressions I have penned in haste,
and send to you as some representation of my state, and a salutation of that respect,
which I desire always to bear towards those who have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

Samuel Scott.

LETTER LX.

Although the apprehension of being soon personally separated from
one to whom I have been so nearly united in the bond of the gospel,
whom I have loved with the most unshaken affection,
and whose friendship and converse I have esteemed one of the greatest blessings of mutability,
had overspread my mind with the shades of anxiety: yet I have at this time to signify,
that he who maketh the clouds his chariot,
hath been pleased in some degree to console my spirit,
by favouring with some views of his all-sufficiency,
and the plenitude and superior excellence of those enjoyments which are in his presence,
and which flow from his holy throne,
and by representing a state of the deepest prostration
and self abasement at the footstool of the Lamb,
to transcend in glory the highest elevations of humanity,
and the most pleasing prospects and dignities of a transient world.

O, my friend, may we, out-soaring all the scenes of sense,
approach with humbled hearts the habitation of the Holiest,
that the skirts of his throne may be our pavilion,
and that in the sympathetic streams of love, we may enjoy an intercourse,
which not distance nor all the strength of men or
devils may ever be able to withhold from us.

It was by such an inseparable covenant, and bond of love,
Jonathan and David not only became of one soul,
but when subjected to an unpleasing separation,
they maintained the most strict and intimate union,
and demonstrated by the most convincing proofs an unshaken attachment.
Methinks I view at this time Jonathan relinquishing in spirit the
grandeur and employments of a sumptuous and brilliant court,
to embrace poor David, when covered with obloquy,
hunted as a partridge upon the mountains,
and secreted in the solitary retreat of Adullam.

May the same divine and inviolable friendship attend us through
the various intricacies and vicissitudes of a mortal sojournment.
A felicity which nothing can frustrate but a defection
in fidelity from the Father of spirits,
whereby the soul comes to forfeit the privileges of immortality,
and to be deprived of those delicate sensations requisite
for the perception of things unseen,
and the enjoyment of things hoped for,
and to be unhappily confined to the objects of sense;
the possession of which may yield a present satisfaction,
but their deprivation a torment for ever.

And now my dear friend,
although I believe strong and many will be the efforts of an unwearied
adversary to divert thee from following the Lord,
and to fill thy soul with creatures and amusements,
yet be not discouraged even though he appear to encompass thy paths with mountains,
and enclose thee in fenced cities: for, behold thy beloved cometh upon the mountains,
causing thy feet to tread upon the high places of the earth.

As these sentiments arose immediately and almost instantaneously in my mind,
at a season when infinite goodness was pleased to relieve my soul in the deepest misery,
I was willing to communicate them, leave them as bread upon the waters,
and therewith salute thee, and bid thee dearly farewell.

Samuel Scott.

LETTER LXI.

Ware, 14th of Third month 1752.

A Concern hath been upon me to invite thee, with my own soul,
to labour in the vineyard of the Lord.
The vineyard of the Lord of hosts, is the heart of man, where he manifests his power,
and displays his almighty operations, for the salvation of his creatures;
and without an admittance thereto, by a divine power,
man is but an intruder into the garden of the Lord,
and all his efforts to labour therein, and to reform his heart and conduct, are vain.

But in that divine visitation, which hath been upon our spirits from year to year,
there hath been a door opened into the vineyard of the Lord,
and a call extended to labour therein.
And now, my friend, if we did but abide in this divine light,
which shows us our own nothingness and misery,
our understanding would be directed to the vision of Infinite fullness,
and our souls brought to rest under the shadow of the Almighty.

In the midst of interruptions and impediments,
we should experience peace and perseverance;
we should then have cause no longer to be fearful of famine,
or terrified at the alarm of war, because the Lord, who had visited us,
would sustain us with bread, and be our defence in the day of adversity.
Even in the extremity of hunger and thirst,
we should taste of the divine all-sufficiency,
and behold the openings of all the treasuries of Jehovah: and when we were nothing,
and had nothing of our own to live or depend upon, the Lord would be our all.
In this path of deep inward poverty and nothingness
hath my spirit been much exercised of late,
even from meeting to meeting, and day to day;
and as I have been made willing thus to remain empty, poor, and naked,
destitute of the sensibility of spiritual enjoyments,
and every consolation not consistent with the Divine will,
I have been favoured with somewhat of the administration of an invisible life,
and a consolation unattainable by the utmost industry and application of man;
and when my soul hath seemed in itself as a dry tree, and as a parched land,
I have tasted angels`' food; the Lord hath been my pasture,
and my springs in the Most High.

To a joint engagement in the guidance and leadings of this divine life,
would I invite thee, my friend, that we may labour together in the garden of the Lord,
and work in his vineyard: then, however concealed we may be from the notice of mortals,
and absent from external aids and assistances,
we shall be ever under the regard of a compassionate Father;
the accomplishment of whose will will be our delight and salvation for ever.

In these lines I have not aimed at elegance of style, or point of expression;
as my design was sincerely the unfolding some Christian experiences and desires,
I thought my theme abundantly above such considerations.
Simple and honest as they are,
I request they may be secreted from the observation of any but thyself,
and my friend +++_________+++.

As heretofore,
I would again recommend thee to a frequent perusal of the writings of the Old and New
Testament those great records of truth and testimonies to the way of life and salvation.
True love and the apprehension of duty induced me to this freedom.

I remain thy sincere friend,

Samuel Scott

LETTER LXII.

15th of Eighth Month, 1778.

This address may inform my friends at +++_________+++, that their kind hospitality,
when with them in times past, neither is nor will be forgotten,
although a correspondence, both personal and epistolary,
hath been of late much suspended.
My wife and self frequently remember them, and the pleasant town where they reside,
which there is little likelihood of my ever again reviewing, having been, for some years,
much indisposed in health.
Indeed, we are both so reduced,
that the time of our continuance here is not likely to be long,
and although there is a considerable disparity in years,
it is rather doubtful which may be the survivor.

Sojourning so near the valley of the shadow of death,
depression is the frequent companion of our spirits; nevertheless,
an humble enquiry is at times within us, "`Where is the Lord our maker,
who giveth songs in the night; who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth;
and maketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?`"

The state of religion among us hereaway, is likewise very low,
almost a daily declension appearing,
although we are generally preserved in a state of outward unity.
Our religious meetings are often very languid,
much more of the form than the power of godliness being prevalent; yet, I humbly hope,
a spiritual solemnity at seasons presides in them.
The shout of Israel`'s king is heard, and the goings forth of Jehovah,
who maketh a way in the sea, and a path in mighty waters, for the poor and afflicted,
are livingly witnessed.
It is very unfrequent that I have freedom to address my friends on this wise,
and often seem incapable of putting two words together properly,
my faculties being much debilitated by bodily infirmities.

I sincerely wish,
that the sufferings of the present time may conduce to our purification,
that having partaken of the cup of trembling, and passed through great tribulations,
our garments may be washed in the blood of the Lamb, who was slain for us;
to whom with the Father, through the eternal spirit, be glory ascribed,
now and for ever.^
footnote:[This appears to be the excellent conclusion
of a correspondence of many years`' continuance;
the friends being all removed by death.]
I am, your affectionate friend,

Samuel Scott.

LETTER LXIII.

London, 11th Ninth month 1768

My Esteemed Friend M. P.

Before I received thy letter thou wast brought to my remembrance,
and I thought that nearness of spirit and dear love that subsisted,
and I hoped was built on a foundation that I earnestly pray
may never be shaken in us (viz. the love of God,
begotten in us,
and shed abroad to all mankind) I say such friendship
demanded some expression of it from me,
but many avocations prevented,
so that thou mayest be assured my silence was not the effect of lessened affection.
And now, to come a little to the subject of thy letter,
in which thou callest on me to mourn thy afflicted situation, I have, as thou desired,
looked at it with some attention, and with a degree of sympathy, but not of mourning,
and cannot help wishing many thousand souls were thus under
the preparing forming hand of a gracious God,
who wills that we should this way come to the knowledge of the truth,
and be saved with an everlasting salvation.
For looking into the book of my little experience,
and indeed into the dealings of our common merciful Father with his children in all ages,
whom he has prepared for his service and glory,
I find they have been as tried vessels in the furnace of afflictions,
and if we look at the two most experienced servants of God, David and Paul,
we may observe none more tempted, tried, tossed, and afflicted,
insomuch that David`'s writings furnish us with very affecting instances of this sort,
to wit, the desertion, for a time, of God`'s spirit and presence;
and we sympathize when we hear his strong cries,
and see his long waiting for the returns of the Divine presence and favour; and Paul,
that eminent servant of the Lord, we find complaining of trials and temptations,
and in deaths oft, without were fightings, and within were fears;
and indeed who are exempt that are resolutely bent to serve the Lord; truly none:
for the Lord`'s servants at this very day, amongst many others,
are tried with deaths oft, as well as frequent temptations, when, as we think,
we are least able to encounter them.
I mean in the absence of our beloved; yet,
when he is pleased thus to try our faith and hope, he in his own time remembers mercy,
and administers a cup of consolation, so that we can say in degree, as the apostle did,
we are cast down, but not forsaken.
This is the hidden manna, that supported; this is the treasure in heaven,
sometimes out of sight, but not out of possession.
In the absence of the bridegroom, who can but mourn?
in such a state, I should not only die, but return again to earth, as David says:
but I remember the years of old,
when I had no solid pleasure in any of its delights and allurements,
and therefore I could not look that way for consolation;
and so have been kept from making other gods in the absence of our spiritual Moses:
in such seasons as these, it has been comfortably presented to my afflicted mind,
that when our Lord relates the parable of a certain man going into a far country,
before he went, he enjoins watchfulness, lest we lose that he left us in possession,
even his love.
Our chief business then is to watch in such seasons,
that no rival be admitted in his absence; but to be ready in a watchful posture,
waiting his return, that as soon as he knocks, we may be ready to let him in.

Keep then, my beloved, that which thou hast received, and let no man take thy crown,
which thou shalt obtain, if thou faintest not; and again remember,
though David was tried deeply, yet he believed,
that he who called him was able to perfect that which concerned him.
He remarks that he had fainted,
but that he believed and hoped to see the Lord in the land of the living.
I write to thee as one that is living and sensible; when thou thinks otherwise,
let me remark, that then thy state is not the state of the spiritually dead.
The dead, says one, know nothing; they have no remembrance of past things;
they forget they were washed; their spiritual faculties cease to act;
they can neither see, hear, fear, love, desire, or pray; whereas, thou dost all these,
otherwise thou couldest not witness what I am sensible
thou dost in this dispensation of trial.
I remember, in such seasons it has been said in my soul,
that I noted and dwelt on all my afflictions, but that I forgot the mercies of God,
which are many to the seed of Jacob.

My dear friend, thou many times mayest and must partake of the cup of affliction;
do not overlook the visits of the love of God, which at times, I will venture to say,
thou dost experience, though they may be like those of a way-faring man,
but for a short season.
Be thankful even for these favours, and let us say with the good old patriarch,
"`I am not worthy of thy mercies;`" and let us remember what the apostle asserts,
that after we have in degree done the manifested will of God,
we have need of patience to wait the fresh discoveries of it, and above all things,
to do it; for I have thought, when we have been helped to add to our faith, temperance,
and self-denial, we shall have need of patience.
I well know thy tried state, and sincerely sympathize with thee, but must desire,
when thou seest where help is laid, use thy degree of sight and faith,
though no more than a seed of mustard: occupy till he come,
who will increase it as thou dost so work.
Remember it will remove mountains.
O let us not fear what the worldly spirit saith, or acts against us;
our dear Lord was buffeted, spit on, hated, and became of no reputation,
taking on him the form of a servant.

I did not expect to write so much, being sensible whose hands thou art under.
If it may in the least contribute to thy encouragement,
and perseverance in the way which is cast up for thee, I shall rejoice: yea,
I do rejoice, in a sense that our gracious God will, in his time, establish, strengthen,
and confirm thee in it, to his praise and glory.
His indeed is the power, and to him, in every dispensation, be the glory.
Amen.

Farewell!
I tenderly salute thee in the tribulation and fellowship of the gospel.

Sophia Hume.

LETTER LXIV.

Thomas Lloyd to John Eccles and wife.

Maesmawr, 12th month 1682.
Loving Friends,

A Living remembrance of you, is and hath been often in my mind,
and a breathing in my soul for your welfare and prosperity in the riches
of that treasury which makes glad the hearts of the possessors thereof,
and which never perish in the using.
There is nothing here, you know full well,
that affords content and satisfaction to the soul
which hath the breath of immortality in it,
but the refreshment and nourishment which it receives from the Bread of Life,
which is daily administered to those who wait for it.

I have been somewhat indisposed as to my health these three weeks,
and my wife seemed even at her accounts`' end: but, however, do fully purpose,
in a few days, unless prevented by my wife`'s condition, or my own personal inability,
to visit thy afflicted wife, where I want not inclinations of warmth to further me.
In the interim,
wishing her the enjoyment of her soul and spirit in the
meek self-denying resignation and patience of the Holy Truth,
and to thyself increase of virtue in the faith of Jesus,

I am your true well-wisher,

Thomas Lloyd.

LETTER LXV.

Mary Peisley to William Brown.

My Dear Friend,

As I am not likely, according to thy request, and my inclination,
to have the satisfaction of seeing thee, I take this opportunity of saluting thee,
in that love which nearly united our spirits, at our first seeing each other; yea,
before I beheld thee with my natural eyes, a prayer was begotten in my soul,
that thou might be made an instrument of good to me,
from the sense of the need I had to be brought forward in the way of righteousness;
which petition I have cause to believe was heard and accepted of the great I AM;
for thou wast not only dipped into a sense of my state, and into near sympathy with me,
by which thou wast made a messenger of consolation to my distressed spirit,
but thy exemplary deportment, solid and edifying conversation,
thy sound and pertinent doctrine to the states of
the people I have seen thee labour amongst,
has incited me to use my weak endeavours for coming up faithfully
in the footsteps of the flocks of the companions of Christ;
and resolutions have been formed, which I trust, by the favour of heaven,
will be supported,
to practice greater degrees of mortification and self-denial than I have ever yet done;
for I see great occasion for it.

I write not this to exalt the creature, or flatter my friend,
but to magnify that grace by which thou art, what thou art,
and to contribute my mite to strengthen thy hands in the way of well-doing,
as I am led to believe the strongest have sometimes need of it;
but perhaps I only judge by myself, who am at times ready to faint in my mind,
from a fear that I shall never be made a conqueror
over those potent enemies which oppose my happiness;
for I have compared my immortal spirit to a kind of immaterial fire,
that is continually catching at or fastening upon something celestial or terrestrial;
and which ever it centers in, it may justly be called an inhabitant of,
and as natural a tendency it has to fix on earthly objects,
that are continually assailing it by the organs of my senses, as iron poised in air,
or cast into water, has to sink: but that power,
by which the prophet caused the axe to swim, in its efficacious operations on the soul,
may be compared to the touch of a loadstone on iron, which attracts it upward,
contrary to its nature; and as iron will lose this attraction,
and return to its natural position, so is my soul ready to sink,
when I wait not carefully for the renewings of that power,
by which we are translated from the kingdom of darkness to that of light:
but so painful and frequent are the operations of the sword of the spirit,
when it comes to sever my soul from the kingdom of this world,
for which it has a great aptitude,
and to divide asunder as between the joints and the marrow,
separating my mind from those things which by nature I am most closely attached to,
it makes me weary of this embodied state of imperfection,
wherein I am torn as between two contraries, heaven and earth,
so that I often long to be dissolved, and to be with Christ.

And though this desire seems to carry in it something laudable,
in as much as it shews my union with eternal excellency
to be stronger than all the ties of nature,
yet I am ready to fear this longing takes its rise
in part from the corrupt source of self-love,
which would lead me to seek an exemption from pain and trial,
before I have filled up in my body, that which is behind of the sufferings of Christ,
for myself and others: but I hope it is excusable,
as our holy pattern has left us the example; when he was about to partake of,
or had begun to taste, that bitter cup of sufferings, for the sins of the world,
he prayed earnestly, and repeatedly, that if it were possible it might pass from him,
but came to this noble result, which all his followers, who are so in reality,
must be brought to, "`Not my will, but thine be done.`"

Surely never did grace and nature exert themselves in so powerful a manner,
each striving for mastery, as in that awful hour,
when the salvation of mankind was at stake,
depending on the obedience of the Son to the Father;
when Christ was wounded for our transgressions, bruised for our iniquities,
and the chastisement of our peace was upon him.
Then might he well adopt that emphatic language, "`Now is my soul troubled,
and what shall I say?`"
As if he had been afraid to let that petition escape his lips, which nature,
sinking under the weight of inexpressible affliction, dictated,
as well befitting a son that had never offended his father, he said,
"`Save me from this hour;`" grace immediately recalls the request,
when he remembered the end of his coming, in that prepared body,
which was for our salvation, "`But for this cause came I to this hour.`"

What could be grievous to his manhood that he did not suffer?
At his birth, a manger, a place for beasts, was his receptacle;
nor did the ungrateful world afford him much better
through the course of his painful pilgrimage;
for though the foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had nests,
He had no place where to lay his head; set at nought by the then visible church,
and high professors of religion; a people that had received the oracles of God;
betrayed by one disciple, denied by another; forsaken by all,
and left to tread the wine press alone, in that most trying hour,
when the wonderful bloody sweat was produced, they slept, and were scattered from him,
when he came to suffer the painful ignominious death of the cross, between two thieves,
as a deceiver.
Many followed him crying, Hosannah, when he rode in triumph;
but now none are desirous to be his companions.
All his acquaintance,
even the women (the most tender by nature) that had followed him from Galilee,
stood a far off.
O, my soul, treasure up these things faithfully in thy remembrance,
with this additional consideration, that it was done in part for thy sake,
without which thou must irretrievably have been lost in the realms of woe,
a fugitive and a vagabond, driven from the face of thy God.
Rejoice then in thy tribulation,
and count it all joy when thou falls into divers temptations and trials,
for the refining of thy faith in Christ.

I hope thou wilt excuse my dwelling so long on this subject; of a truth,
it is a favourite theme, which I can never too much ponder; it is therefore needless,
and I recall the expression.
It will be a part of the employment of seraphic spirits, to all eternity,
to admire and celebrate the mysteries of redeeming love; saying with a loud voice,
"`Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and wisdom, riches and strength.
Honour and blessing to him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb forever.`"

1t is time for me to draw towards a conclusion,
which I shall do with hearty desires for thy preservation every way,
and prosperity in the glorious work thou art engaged in,
hoping thou wilt remember me when it fares well with thee.

Please to let me hear from thee, if leisure and freedom permit;
but I shall leave that and all other things of this
kind to the direction of our great and good Master,
not laying thee under any other restraint but love, well knowing thy various engagements.

I am, with love, in which our family joins me, thy friend in the fellowship of the gospel,

Mary Peisley.

LETTER LVI.

An Epistle by Mary Smith.

To my Brethren of the Ministry in Norfolk, tenderly Greeting.

From the Island of Jersey, 21st of 12th month 1750.

My dear brethren! called and chosen of God, appointed for a good work in your day,
see to your callings, gifts, and talents received, and let none come short of faith,
fully occupying to the glory and honour of him who hath indeed called
and honoured you with the abundant riches and treasure of his house,
viz. a dispensation of his gospel to preach to mankind.
Lift up your voice like trumpets, and be not dismayed,
though the enemy hath roared in your borders,
and the dragon hath cast forth his floods variously,
yet put on strength in the arm of the Lord, and behold your salvation near,
that shall be a bulwark in every trying time.
Oh! my brethren, my spirit hath been in deep travail for you, beloved in the work,
and fellow partakers of the heavenly gifts.
The call of the Lord through me is,
stand fast in the sweet liberty wherewith Christ hath once made you free,
and be not entangled again with the yoke of any bondage.
Suffer not, I beseech you,
the encumbrances and cares of this mutable and perishing life to choke the precious seed,
or in the least to obstruct your holy concern for God and his cause.
Remember, through unfaithfulness, Saul lost his kingdom and crown,
and became as one that had not been anointed with oil; the beauty of Israel was slain,
and fell upon the high places of Gilboa.
Have a care of high things, my brethren,
of accommodating yourselves or your houses to the world`'s inclinations, manners,
or spirit: though this might acquire you much favour, credit, and access with men,
literal carnal professors, or half-turned mongrel ones, yet it never can with God,
since he that is a friend of the world is an enemy to God,
is the express doctrine and testimony of the blessed apostle.
I long to have you men after God`'s own heart, Davids indeed, without blemish,
without re proof; so shall the goodly oil shine,
and the beauty of the Lamb`'s anointing be your excellent adorning.
The light of the Lord God will fill your dwellings,
and his blessing be upon all that appertains to you;
your families and little ones will reap the blessed benefit of your hearty obedience.

It was the complaint of old,
when the summons was sent to the called and chosen guests
who should have had the honour of composing that assembly,
that they made light of it, and went each his own way, one to his farm,
another to his merchandise, or in other words, one had purchased,
and he must see and possess; a second had bought yokes of oxen,
and he must needs prove them: a third had married a wife, and he would be excused.
I pray God, my brethren, it may not be so with you: but on the other hand, your ardour,
your readiness, and obedience to the divine call,
may really answer to that of the centurion`'s servants who needed but to say to one go,
and he goeth; to another come, and he cometh; and to a third do this, and he doeth it.
O! excellent fidelity and submission! no doubt it ingratiated
them in the love and affection of their Master,
and engaged him to their interests, who so much regarded his;
and shall the sons of heaven, the servants of the Lord of the whole earth be less noble,
less vigilant?
Surely nay; the Lord forbid it should be so.
Everlasting life, and the rewards of a blessed eternity,
is the portion and durable inheritance of all them that thus in
the house and service of their heavenly master and captain,
come up in their several calls and duties; but I am afraid some are saying, I go,
and go not.
I know there are good hearts among you, tender and true to the cause,
but fearfulness and diffidence on sundry occasions take hold,
and to favour this weakness, pleadings, and reasonings come in,
till the obstruction be comes as a flood, viz. Some there are who have been too forward,
too hasty, and too heady, and alas, what are they come to;
the name of the Lord is reproached on their account, and I, what shall I do?
the like dangers, the like temptations, may attend me, and I had rather die,
or live my days in obscurity, than hurt the blessed cause in such a manner,
or bring any reproach to Sion, the city of God`'s solemnity,
where the true citizens are pure, solemn, and orderly in their dwellings.
Ah, my mournful brethren, are these some times your pleadings,
are these your solitary cogitations and heart-tendering
moans that weigh you down as into the bottom of Jordan,
with the weight of the call and work upon your shoulders?
Gird up your loins, fear not; lift up your heads and arise;
bring up your grateful memorials, the goodly stones for building,
on which your feet have stood firm.
Now, I know it is agreeable to the apostles`' doctrine,
that the strong should bear with the weak, and if a brother commit a fault,
he that is spiritual should strive in the spirit of meekness to restore such an one,
and I hope-due care is taken in your respective meetings
to put this evangelical precept in practice;
nevertheless not to the prejudice or hazard of the good cause,
but see that your members are sound or safely restored.
Believe not mere formal appearances or literal acknowledgments,
for all is not gold that glitters; but bring offenders upon the proof:
"`The tree is known by its fruits; an evil tree will not bring forth good fruit,
nor a good tree evil fruit.`"

The rule is plain, my brethren, the matter need not be difficult,
only stand upon your guard,
having each "`his sword girt upon his thigh because
of fear in the night;`" you know what I mean,
and in the unalterable love of the covenant I salute you
in your several distinct orders and rule in the church,
and may here remind you of the subtle Gibeonites that deceived
good Joshua and the other ministers and elders:
lay not sudden hands upon any one,
but wait to know all in the light;--that will discover
you all conditions and states without partiality.
And where any poor tender one is found sincere and true, and the birth to be of God,
O nourish it, whether in rich or poor, high or low, bond or free, servant or master;
let due care be taken that no imprudent shyness or reserve be manifested to such,
for in so doing you will make them bleed, wound them in the tenderest part,
and they will mourn as between the porch and the altar.
Learn to know one another, my brethren; let brotherly love continue;
so shall you be shepherds indeed in Israel,
and the memorial of you will be sweet when your day`'s work here is done,
and like Moses and Joshua, you leave the tribes militant.
My heart is tendered, and my spirit contrited,
and in much brokenness and tears have you been brought to my remembrance,
even at seasons when I knew not but my natural life was hastening to its period,
and the days of my weary travail and pilgrimage were near at end;
then my bowels yearned towards you in the Lord,
and I looked over you my brethren with abundance of love and concern,
that you might all work while it is yet day,
while favour continues and some bodily health and strength be given;
before the night cometh and the shadows of the evening approach, favour be removed,
or bodily weakness clothe; ah! then no working.
The remembrance of you was very pleasant to me,
I received some of you deep in your dwellings,
and who I trust are as pillars in the house that shall go no more out.
Oh, methought I saw the holy writing,
the heavenly characters of the new name and of the new Jerusalem, the holy city,
and a motion followed these renewed sensations to tender you these lines.

I make no doubt, my brethren, but some of you, and I hope all,
will accept the love in which my heart was opened and enlarged to you in my weakness,
in which I felt endeared and fervent the love of your and my heavenly Father,
manifested in and through his beloved Son Jesus Christ, to whom be ascribed glory,
salvation and honour.
Amen.

Your friend and sister, I hope, in the saints`' travail and tribulation,

Mary Smith.

LETTER LVII.

Sophia Hume to Hannah Hyam.

Philadelphia, 1st of 6th month 1748.

My Dear Friend,

It is but a few days since I received thy kind and very acceptable letter,
dated the 13th of 12th month last, which came to hand after a very remarkable manner.
An inhabitant of this place, a friend`'s son, having been to Carolina,
on his return from thence took it up on a bank or shore near Carolina, with some others,
they being, as conjectured, thrown overboard by some vessel pursued by an enemy,
but whether in a conveyance to Carolina, or from thence to this city,
I have not been able to learn; however, I am pleased to have received it,
though in a torn and ragged, yet legible form,
and should gladly have received my daughter`'s also, though in the same condition,
but it is not a little satisfactory to me to hear by thine of her welfare,
as as of thine, and my dear family.

Thou hast, my dear friend,
nearly engaged me to thee on account of thy kind and sympathizing concern
for my protection and preservation by the good hand of our God,
whose mercies extend over all his works,
as well as what I am certain we are both interested in, to wit,
the cause and honour of our great Master,
and the real good and happiness of mankind universally.
The affinity and unity of spirit I witnessed on this
score soon after my happy acquaintance with thee,
and the time now occurs to me wherein after I had
one day made thee a visit (not a ceremonious one,
such as are commonly made by the world) but one wherein
I was edified and consolated in my spirit,
arising from, as I then thought, a sympathy of soul, both seeming to tend one way,
viz. To our great centre, God.
Upon my return home, and revolving in my mind something on this occasion,
I felt a secret joy and pleasure in thy friendship,
and I loved thee not so much for my own sake as for the sake of our dear Lord:
this pleasing reflection caused tears of joy to flow plentifully from my eyes:
this unity of spirit in the bond of peace and love, flowing from essential love itself,
even from God, "`for truly our fellowship is with the Father,
and with his Son Christ Jesus.`"
A stranger neither knows nor can intermeddle with this joy.
It is this commerce and union of souls, thou art sensible, my friend,
that only deserves or can justly claim the tender name and significant title of friendship:
for though Christians indeed love all mankind,
and are so far friends to all as to ardently desire and pray for their eternal happiness,
and would contribute all in their power to promote it,
as well as their temporal felicity,
yet the sacred and expressive name of friendship belongs
only to those whose souls are united by this holy cement,
the love of God;
for though there may be in persons all the requisites to
form and continue a common and selfish affection or friendship,
viz. similitude in natural tempers and dispositions, sympathies and antipathies,
affections and aversions, yet when this holy attraction and bond is wanting,
the friendship is incomplete and insipid.

And now, dear friend, I must tell thee that thy conjecture was not without foundation,
when thou apprehended that a concern superior to worldly interest (which
indeed had little or no share in my voyage) engaged me to quit so desirable
a situation (in such a hazardous and even perilous juncture),
wherein I thought myself happy in the enjoyment of many valuable friends,
with whom I had frequent and glorious opportunities of going
up to the house or into the presence of God,
in sweet company and fellowship,
where the divine and desirable communion of the heavenly bread and new wine of
the kingdom has been often dispensed to my hungering and thirsty soul,
both immediately from the divine hand, from whom every good and perfect gift comes,
and instrumentally from God`'s ministers;
for which kindness and favour of the Lord to my soul,
I have been made often and truly thankful.
Thus happy, exquisitely happy, was I,
as far as one engaged in the Christian warfare can be,
in the enjoyment in some degree of the favour of the Almighty,
which was better to me than life;
when a concern I had often had for the inhabitants of my
native country revived in my soul for their eternal happiness;
whither I was to return and abase myself by declaring what God had done for my soul,
and to call them from those things which I had been
by the great love and power of God redeemed from;
this discovery of the divine will gave me the greatest uneasiness I think I ever felt,
the greatest cross I ever had to bear, and which I long reasoned against,
and implored the Almighty if it was his will to remove the burden.
The time would fail to recount the various consultations of flesh and blood,
the difficulties and dangers laid in my way through this hard and trying dispensation;
at length all obstacles were removed by the Hand of Power,
and nothing now remained in my way but my unwillingness to become a fool,
to go and abase myself in my native country,
where I had long lived in pride and exaltation of mind,
and forgetfulness of God my Creator and preserver.
I fain would have compounded with the Almighty,
and though but a worm pleaded greatly to be excused thus:
Oh! that it might be granted me all my days to live in obscurity,
sequestered from all worldly enjoyments,
to weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my native land;
I could have been content to have sat in silence,
and gone softly all my days for their sake:
but this was not the divine will concerning me,
the word was gone forth "`Obey my voice,`" and was not to return empty or void.
Here I was shewn that obedience is better than any sacrifice not prepared of God,
and to hearken to the voice of the Lord in this command,
than any offering I could offer in my own will,
for none but those of his own preparing and ordaining can possibly be acceptable to him.
Thus in the day of God`'s power, and by the assistance of his divine hand,
I was enabled to run through a troop of reasonings,
and by the strength of my God I have leaped over a wall of opposition in my own breast,
and as I before informed thee I found it my place and duty
to keep to meetings with those few who professed with me,
and at first met with some rude uncivil treatment,
yet we enjoyed our meetings the remaining time with pretty much quiet;
and some of the inhabitants of the town would now and then come and sit with us,
to whom my mouth was sometimes opened, in rehearsing what God had done for my soul.

In the course of my continuing there a concern was laid upon my mind to
write a short account of the dealings of the Lord to bring me to himself,
with an exhortation to the inhabitants,
and as I could not conveniently get it printed in
Carolina in the time I proposed to stay there,
I have brought it to Philadelphia, where I am told I can have it better done;
and the conveyance from hence being easy, I hope to send it soon.
This affair, and the want of a suitable opportunity, will detain me, I believe,
six weeks longer from my dear children and friends.
I am obliged to thee for thy care in soliciting for a few more books;
if they are not yet sent please to let it be deferred till I arrive.
I have dispersed many in South Carolina,
which were by many acceptably and thankfully received,
as well as those I have distributed in my journey from thence to Pennsylvania,
in a course of between eight and nine hundred miles;
wherein the goodness of the Almighty was very conspicuous in preserving me through many,
and to me unusual difficulties and straits, for which mercy,
as well as for innumerable others,
my soul renders to his protecting goodness unfeigned thanksgiving and high praises.
The particulars I must defer till I am conducted
by the same merciful hand to my friends and family,
when I shall be more at leisure to relate them than I am at present.
I am pleased to hear there is a suspension of arms between the contending powers,
though we fear Spain is not included in the treaty;
so it is possible we may not be quite out of danger from that quarter.
However,
that divine and omnipotent power who has so far kept me by his
mercy from falling into the hands of unreasonable men,
will, I trust, continue to protect me from temporal as well as spiritual enemies,
which are most dangerous, and therefore most to be feared and guarded against.

The time I am limited to, by the vessel`'s sailing this afternoon,
obliges me to draw to a conclusion,
and add no more but my tender love and regard to thee, and all my dear family,
remaining in true gospel love, Thy real and affectionate friend,

Sophia Hume.

LETTER LVIII.

From Mary Peisley to E. and T. Ecroyd.

Exeter, 26th of 6th month 1749.

My Dear Friends,

I Have been with my dear companion Mary Weston since the
yearly meeting through four of the southern counties;
a fine well cultivated country, whose fields seem to want no improvement,
being richly adorned with plentiful crops;
these with beautifully enamelled and fragrant pastures, with dumb eloquence,
abundantly praise and magnify the great Creator,
setting forth to every intelligent mind the magnificence of his power, wisdom, goodness,
bounty, and long-suffering, to a race of degenerate unworthy mortals,
whose tongues are filled with cursing and profaneness instead of
thanksgiving and praise for the unmerited favours of him,
who maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,
and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

So far as I am capable of discerning,
religion is at a very low ebb in this part of the
world amongst all ranks and societies of people.
Perhaps you will say I want charity, or upbraid me as Joseph did his brethren,
of coming to spy the nakedness of the land.
I tell you nay; but to buy food for the sore famine of the soul by obedience, which,
could I have had at home, I would not have come here.
Though I thus freely write my thoughts as they occur,
I have no doubt but I am known by you, as well as Joseph`'s brethren were by him,
though to many where I come I am unknown, and remain so.

I have far passed the limits of my letter, but feeling my heart enlarged in that love,
which neither length of time nor distance of place can extinguish or impair,
hope you will excuse the freedom,
and accept of salutation in the unchangeable truth in which I greet you with love unfeigned;
also to your father, mother, and family, with any other enquiring friends, as if named,
from your truly affectionate friend,

Mary Peisley.

LETTER LIX.

From Sophia Hume to Anthony Benezet, which was found unfinished after her decease.
Beloved Friend,

I Believe I may say, and say truly, I am not pleased with myself,
that I have not gratified thy request in that I did not reply earlier to thy last letter,
as I have the same reason thou alleged to me,
lest I should by any means make my friend uneasy;
but so far was thy letter from producing that effect,
that my heart rejoiced to find as heretofore,
thou through grace continues a stedfast and faithful sufferer for Christ and the gospel`'s
sake with the few names who amidst the revolting tribes of our Israel,
have not bowed their knee to Baal, neither kissed his image.
But on the other hand I cannot but mourn, nor remain unmoved,
while our tribes are in the wilderness,
surrounded by their enemies and taken captive at their wills;
for this my spiritual as well as natural bread hath been often mixed with tears.
I further lament to find both here and in the churches abroad,
that "`blindness in part hath happened to our Israel,`"
and the seeming unwillingness to be healed continuing,
makes me fear it will ere long prove both fatal and total;
but if Israel will not be gathered,
the Lord will cause the feet of his messengers to
be turned to such as will answer his call,
and prove more faithful to his laws and precepts,
for he never did nor ever will leave himself without
witnesses to his mighty power and adorable love,
which in his own time will cover the earth in a twofold
sense as the waters cover the sea,
for his determination is, "`He will be glorified on earth, as he is glorious in heaven.`"

Perhaps I am too anxious for this happy and glorious period;
I want to see the time when the mountain of the Lord`'s
house shall be established on the top of every exalted mountain,
which poor unhappy mortals have raised to their own destruction.
I want to see the people take the armour of God,
as it is graciously offered by the captain of our salvation,
and disposed to fight under his banner;
the weapons of salvation are mighty to the pulling down of strong
holds of sin and satan and bringing into captivity every imagination
that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.
I am fearful I am fretting too much (rather let me say lamenting) because of evil doers;
though I am thankful to the keeper of Israel he preserves
me from being envious at the workers of iniquity;
so far from envying I mourn and lament their state,
and as Paul in the word of the Almighty commanded,
that "`prayer and supplication be made for all men,`" so in my mea sure
I am enabled to address the Father of Mercies with strong cries,
prayers, and many tears, that all men may be blessed with the knowledge of the truth,
and be saved from sin here, and the dreadful penalty due to it hereafter;
and as I have witnessed the terrors of the Lord for sin,
and upon deep repentance and amendment of life,
the peace and consolation of his blessed spirit for
obedience to the light and truth of his dear Son,
I would fain persuade men who have received the same grace by which we are saved,
to embrace his repeated merciful calls, to occupy therewith,
that they may not receive his grace in vain.

Sophia Hume.

LETTER LX.

To

Redruth, 11th month 2nd, 1793.

Dear Friend,

For with that epithet I hope I may address thee in the spiritual relationship,
having felt an affectionate sympathy with and regard for thee,
although our personal acquaintance has not been such
as might induce a very free expression of it.
But one of my chief joys in my debilitated state is,
the hearing or seeing that the children of the elect lady
(which the church of Christ may be styled) walk in the truth;
and a principal evidence of my continuing a living member of that church,
is my retaining a love to the brethren.
Indeed, I hope that this love is increased in my state of weakness,
and my desires are strong that the plantation of God may be so watered, weeded, pruned,
and watched over, as that its plants may flourish and be fruitful,
according to their kind, and the uses he assigns them.
That all the trees and plants in his extensive garden may rejoice together,
because they experience the advantage arising from
their sheltering each other from storms,
and expediting each other`'s growth,
although it may in some instances appear to diminish
the spreading of some plants of large magnitude,
and which also may be deeply rooted.
Such must at times evince their humility and true greatness by a willingness to be lopped,
that room may be made for young valuable plants growing near them, to expand.
Indeed, I see occasion for old trees, in the spiritual plantation, to be pruned,
as well as young ones, if they continue fruitful in the different seasons of life;
if they will not abide it,
barrenness and a contemptible appearance awaits them in the closing stage of life,
though they have been fruitful in the earlier periods of it.
May all the Lord`'s plants desire that he may turn his hand upon
them as often as he sees it needful for their preservation,
that they may produce well flavoured fruit in that
proportion which he knows their roots can bear.
Alas what great occasion is there for this pruning work in our highly favoured society.
How many wild shoots have been suffered to remain and grow,
even to the destruction of some promising trees,
shoots which have plenteously produced the fruits of the first nature,
although they may not have the appearance of the worst kind.
How heavy laden with fruits of worldly mindedness are some,
whose outward appearance is specious.
Pretended self-denial is in many instances self-gratification,
and their zeal is not according to knowledge.
These masked characters among us (it appears to me) do more hurt than open libertines;
they create a distrust of the whole body of our members,
brand us with the stigma of hypocrisy, and sorely wound the living remnant,
who mourn for offences they cannot remedy,
and lament the discouragement administered by them to tender infant plants in our garden.

But what saith the divine inspector to those who
see and lament the state of these burdensome members?
"`Take heed to yourselves,`" and when your hearts and hands are cleansed,
arise and labour in my garden to remove such plants
as will not be restored to beauty and fruitfulness;
and wisely nurse and train up those who are willing to receive instruction;
endeavour to support the weak, to comfort the feeble-minded, reprove, exhort,
rebuke with all long-suffering and meekness.
Thus may you be instrumental to work a reformation,
and your spirits will be replenished with divine peace and love,
which will compensate for all labours, sufferings,
and the loss of every temporal blessing wherewith you may be tried.
It appears clear to me,
that if our living brethren and sisters who are not
called to labour publicly in word and doctrine,
solemnly attended to their share of this rectifying work,
it would tend to an increase of true spiritual unity and sympathy amongst us.
There are indeed but few experienced fathers whose minds are affectionately
exercised for the children`'s growth and preservation,
which is probably one cause why there are not more of the
rebellious children turned to the wisdom of the just.
Private judicious admonition and cautions are not duly administered,
or endeavours used to gather the youthful stragglers
under the sheltering wing of wise elders.
I am thankfully sensible, notwithstanding, that the Lord is at work amongst us,
and I believe he will work powerfully to the reducing of the wills
of some who have been educated in the profession of the truth,
to the obedience of sonship,
and others who have wandered upon the mountains will become inhabitants of the valleys,
and be settled under the government of Israel`'s Shepherd.

But even such as are seeking the way to Zion,
and are earnestly desirous to be everlastingly united to the Lord and his people,
need much attention and help; they have much to leave behind,
and many discouragements to encounter;
and I think I have seen that if Friends watched over
such as are looking towards us in wisdom,
with a desire to be helpers of their faith,
and endeavoured by honest labour to rectify their errors and defects,
more of these might be brought forward, and in time become an additional strength to us.
I had no view of penning the foregoing sentiments when I began to write to thee,
but finding an inclination to reply to thy acceptable letter of the 10th ult.,
I have ventured to communicate them, in hope that if they meet thy own,
it may tend to strengthen thy resolution to attend to thy share
of any part of the work divine wisdom may assign thee in his church.
It has pleased him to deprive thee of one of his most valuable temporal blessings;
may it tend to thy enlargement in spiritual gifts, and increase of the highest enjoyment.

I observe thy remark of the probability of this nation
sharing in a greater degree than it has yet done,
of the cup of trembling, of which a neighbouring one drinks so deeply;
as a religious body called to peace, we should study to promote it,
and how we may edify not only one another,
but those also who may differ from us in religious profession;
exampling them how they ought to demean themselves
consistent with the gospel of the Prince of Peace;
and if suffering be our lot, either for our testimony of a good conscience,
or in sharing the calamities wherewith the nation may be visited,
to seek for strength to bear them consistent with the dignity of our high, holy,
and peaceable profession.

Had thy business led thee this way,
I should have been pleased to have seen thee and
conversed with thee in the love and freedom of truth.
I am visited by some valuable friends,
yet at times conclude myself a solitary afflicted widow,
increasing in bodily infirmities,
and able to do but little to promote the cause of righteousness.
He who judgeth righteously only knows the cause of my late great affliction,
whereto my most affectionate friends were in a great measure blind.
May the dispensation of his mercy and judgment be so sanctified
to my spirit as to prepare it for admittance into his kingdom
when dislodged from this decrepit and much afflicted tabernacle.

Thy affectionate friend,

Catharine Phillips.

LETTER LXI.

1776+++.+++

Dear Friend, I Had thy letter in answer to mine,
which gave me pleasure in various respects.
Thy commemoration of the favour and blessings of
heaven dispensed to thee in thy infant state,
when like Jacob thou went from thy father`'s house only with thy staff,
and now thou art become two bands, by the shedding of the blessings on thy head,
which as lived under will increase and multiply still to greater degrees of dominion.
Be attentive therefore to the motion of light,
suffer thyself to be girded by the holy girdle,
and thy back will be strengthened for work,
thy standing will be pronounced sure by thy stability,
and thy head will be covered in the day of battle.
I am not insensible how men are attacked by the grand enemy;
if he fails when he has them in one position,
he attempts to draw them from it by another with a view of better success.
If the banner be over us,
in the limitation assigned by the guardian angel of preservation,
let ns keep under it and we shall be secure;
the enemy will not be able to prevail against us,
when we have the glorious fence of the Lord`'s appointment.
There are seasons when the affectionate part is up in men,
and they propose things agreeable to nature in ourselves,
that we are ready to comply with; this makes the way intricate to ourselves,
for when we bring it to the standard it is deficient in weight and purity,
and will not pass the trial before the judge.
I have missed it in this respect, and therefore drop the caution to my friend,
to beware of giving expectation, before it is tried in the balance of the sanctuary.
King`'s children should always preserve their dignity,
by taking heed how they mix amongst the people,
and their associations and alliances ought to be with the royal lineage;
in this the King of kings is honoured, and our own dignity preserved;
I do not mean this with regard to thy present undertaking in England,
I mean with respect to others whom we converse with, and are sometimes amongst,
both male and female, though it may hold good in both.

There are many more talkers of the truth than walkers in it, whose mouths flatter,
and whose tongues are their own and ought to be stopped,
though they appear to be something in word and shew when they come
in their ranks and appear amongst the disciplined army;
they are not noticed nor sent forth against the Goliaths of the day;
it is only those who are anointed and appointed,
armed and accoutred that can face the battle.
May we, dear friend, dwell with the consuming virtue of the word, that as we are used,
we may still be refined.

I would just say with regard to the present depending affair, do not be too precipitate;
weigh it, and remember that he that believeth maketh not haste;
there are many things to be looked at, thy place, thy friend`'s place.
Things with a fair face of prospect may be shaded with a gloom;
sweet things in enjoyment may change to bitter; I would not cast any thing out,
to embarrass, or overwhelm, but simply speak my feelings; relinquishing for the cause,
in our affections, enriches after in a spiritual and temporal sense,
and it is often tenfold restored.
It was said in the recapitulation of the many blessings dispensed to David,
after shewing him what he was,
"`and if this had not been enough I would have done much more.`"
This was when he was taken off his watch,
and suffered his affections to sport with a beauteous object,
which in the end made him flee before his enemy;
this thou may think not similar to thy present state: but yet it points the obedience,
the dedication that ought to attend a being raised
to eminence by the interposition of a supreme Power,
in order to shew forth his power in him.

The satisfaction resulting from thy letter on this subject was great,
because with respect to a removal, in looking at it I think thou tells me,
thou never saw light shine upon it.
This satisfaction arises from my being of the same sentiment, and one in judgment,
when most capable to judge and feel for myself, and for my friend.
Let this affair be hewn and squared in the mount before it is adopted,
and let there be no sound of an artificial tool in bringing it about,
that the substituting a member from one part of the body to another,
may be the Lord`'s work, and then it will be useful,
and to the edification and comfort of the body, the church.
I sympathize with thee and thy friend, I love you both in the truth, and my desire is,
that you may be conducted in wisdom in bringing it forward,
or in finally letting it drop,
and for every sacrifice thus made it will be amply made up,
by the replacing one in its stead in which your acceptance will stand,
your faith be confirmed, and your righteousness be proved, as was faithful Abraham`'s.

I am now, my dear friend, on the eve of my departure;
I stole this little season from hurry to converse with thee, and tell thee how I felt.
My things are all gone aboard, and on the morrow I expect to embark.
A letter from John Oxley informed his brother was
expected to get clear of the land about the 5th instant,
by a letter received, so that we may have some expectation to meet, if at all,
soon in the western world.
A correspondence with thee will be agreeable, as a little intelligence in a strange land,
is very pleasing to pilgrims.
I should have been pleased to have heard what thou intends,
and how thou feels with respect to going over the water soon.
Keep thy integrity, and put thy self in the hands of a faithful Creator,
that sleeps not by day, nor slumbers by night.
Consider thyself at his disposal, not man`'s of any kind, neither R. D.`'s,
nor any other man`'s that is but flesh, and consequently frail.
Farewell, may wisdom and knowledge be the stability of thy time while on earth,
and may the fear of the Lord prove thy glory, in which desire:
joined by my wife in near love and affection, I remain thy truly loving friend,

Samuel Neale.

LETTER LXII.

From Doctor Fothergill to the Meeting for Sufferings.

Near Middlewick, Cheshire, 20th 8th month 1770.

Dear Friends,

As you are frequently in my thoughts when absent from you,
an inclination seemed to arise in my mind,
just to express the cordial regard I feel for you, both as a body, and as individuals;
often have I been filled with thankfulness that my lot has been cast amongst you;
much benefit have I received from the wisdom that
hath been manifested in the conduct of your affairs;
and I often consider you as an assembly of the most favoured people in the whole city,
may I not say in the whole society.
It seldom escapes me, when I sit down with you,
fervently to desire that we may always when we meet feel a degree of that solemn awe,
which I am sure is often felt among us,
and that none may go away without being the better for their meeting:
and I esteem it a signal mercy that in the midst of so many unavoidable engagements,
and in the increase of which I think my heart has no delight,
a desire is kept alive to be united nearer if possible to every tender mind amongst you,
to profit by their example,
and to be divested of every thing that might not contribute to the help of individuals,
or advantage to the whole.
May I just say,
that I fervently wish an awful reverence may clothe
every mind when ye are collected together;
the more closely and steadily we can unite here,
the better we shall be enabled to judge properly, and act wisely,
concerning the things that are brought before us.

It is not in my thoughts to esteem myself proper
to give advice to such a body of sensible friends,
whom I honour in the truth;
but it seemed pleasingly to arise in my mind to testify
my brotherly remembrance by these few lines,
and to be a kind of prompter, though at a distance,
to consider your importance in regard to the well-being of the society,
as instruments in the hand of Providence for much good;
and to consider what frame of mind such meetings should be held in.
I know from experience that many of you come together with such dispositions,
and that I may do so likewise, and that others who may even be behind me,
may come up in the same earnest endeavour to be what they should be, is now,
and often has been, my desire.

It is not boastingly, but with a degree of humble gratitude that I can mention,
though absent from you, my heart is with you often.
This favourable recess is not granted, that it may be spent in dissipation or indolence:
wish to renew my strength both of body and mind,
and to seek after that which can renew it properly.
I salute you in much affection, and am,

Your friend and brother,

John Fothergill.

LETTER LXIII.

It is worthy of consideration that when our society was under sore and cruel persecution,
it greatly flourished both as to number and the addition of excellent men:
for notwithstanding their sufferings were great,
the best of them were enabled patiently to bear them,
although they sometimes suffered the loss of all things;
but the worst who could not suffer for the truth were swept away,
and thereby the society was so refined,
that all impartial sensible men who observed the lives of our forefathers,
and impartially examined their principles, began more or less to lean towards them,
and many of the best of other societies joined them.
But persecution has in a great measure ceased, and we are become drossy.
What is to refine us now?
If we refine, or are refined, we shall certainly grow again.
These I take to be truths substantially founded; therefore I say again,
what is to refine us as a people considered in connection with each other,
as a community?
Nothing now surely but our excellent discipline, administered by men of truth,
men fearing God, hating covetousness; men gifted,
fitted and qualified by the head of the church for the service thereof;
men of clean hands and upright hearts, whose concern it is to keep the church clean,
well knowing her prosperity depends on her purity,
and that her holy head will never enlarge a church but in the way of righteousness,
and by a real reformation.
Now nothing is more manifest than this,
that our forefathers separated from the established
religion of this country on a ground of reformation,
and we both believe that a separation on any other ground is not justifiable:
but on this principle and bottom quite commendable.
Now it seems reasonable to suppose a society so founded,
and often recurring to its foundation,
must be the best and most disinterested in the world,
and low as our society is fallen for want of such recurring,
yet I know of none in which we can see so much devotion of time and talents,
and-generous labour to social service, as in ours.
The present visit to the monthly and quarterly meetings
of Friends in this nation and in Ireland,
is a fresh instance of this sort,
which I hope will be performed by such as have not only
a strong affection rightly founded for the society,
but who have also well considered, that as a people,
according to the words of our Saviour,
we are "`as a city set on an hill:`" i. e. as I understand it,
made most obvious by our singularities,
and therefore we ought to take good heed to the reasonable command that follows;
to let our light so shine before men, that they seeing our good works,
may glorify the Father which is in heaven.
Doubtless,
the best part of the society have well retained and considered this excellent precept,
and have had great care to adorn the doctrine preached
among us by a suitable life and conversation;
and I am fully persuaded,
had we all been as careful in this respect as we ought to have been,
where there is one now under our name there would have been hundreds, if not thousands;
but instead of the ignorance of foolish men being put to silence, by our well-doing,
of which the apostle says, "`for so is the will of God;`" their mouths have,
by our evil doings, been opened, not only to reproach us,
but to speak evil of the truth professed by us.

It is justly to be feared that many seeking souls, under divine visitations,
inclining to us, have been stumbled by our stumbling blocks.
These are sorrowful things, and what is to be done?
Surely the camp must be searched, or to speak in more familiar language,
a stricter hand must be kept on scandalous reproachful things;
things which are a shame to any people, but abominable in us,
more especially where the phylacteries are broad, the appearance plain,
the garb and heart at variance.

Thou hast, doubtless, looked on virtue and vice as great things, and considered families,
societies, and nations as happy or miserable, sooner or later,
in proportion as one or the other prevails; and if so,
what has this empire to expect but desolation, confusion, and distress,
because wickedness abounds, of which I fear there is too much among us,
the love of many waxing cold in the cause of virtue, truth, and righteousness.

In short, nothing is plainer than this, that a general reformation is wanted,
and nothing ought to be more earnestly sought for
by us than that we as a people may lead the way,
remembering where judgment must begin,
and Were the unrighteous things purged from us by our discipline,
I have no doubt but we should flourish again.
The principle we profess is still the same,
and would make us as illustrious as were our fathers,
if we attended to it in the same manner they did, and as readily obeyed it.
Their hope of glory was rationally founded on their belief,
that their Saviour made himself manifest within.
This was what they were convinced of, to him they retired,
and became an inward and spiritually minded people;
and this enabled them to bring forth the excellent
fruits of the spirit enumerated by the apostle,
in which they excelled all others who were not so turned.
Their peculiar exhortation, as I may term it, was, Turn thy mind inward.
They themselves had found the benefit of so doing,
and being in their ministry under the constraint of divine love to the souls of men,
they were desirous that others might reap the same advantage.
And indeed this is so much the one thing needful,
that no man can be substantial in religion without it; without it,
'tis an everlasting truth, he will be either no Christian, or a poor superficial one,
perhaps washing the outside of the cup and the platter,
but neglecting the most essential cleansing of the inside.
It was turning inward turned me from deism to Christianity;
and for the truth of Christianity I have found there are evidences enough within,
evidences sufficient to convince any honest enquiring rational soul,
who will turn inward and compare the spiritual things made manifest within,
with the spiritual things written without in the Holy Scriptures.
And surely there cannot be a better or fairer way of dealing
with unbelievers than referring them to their own feelings,
that is, to what they have felt and what they may feel in their own bosoms.
This is surely the rational way to conviction, and introductory to that of conversion,
which no wise man will be content without experiencing,
and which the wiser we are the more we desire.
Our merciful and kind Creator hath wifely and impartially
linked our duty and our interest together,
and doubtless hath unalterably determined,
that the one shall for ever bear a proportion to the other.
One is a proof of his kindness, the other of his justice,
which shews he is til to be as he is "`the judge of all the earth,`"
determined to reward every man according to his works;
now if these things are so,
what enemies are we to ourselves when we do any thing that is evil,
and how untrue to our interest when we omit doing
that good for which we might be for ever rewarded.
This shews how wise we are for ourselves, and how beneficent to others when well employed.

I am well assured that he who is the head of the church is not unmindful of it,
but very tender of its welfare,
and still ready to bless us with gifts and qualifications necessary to this good end.
But this is proper to be remembered, that all who are qualified are humble men,
men who have been humbled under the mighty hand of God,
for there are none but such truly humble.
They that are, as the beloved disciple expresses it,
"`passed from death unto life,`" and that way are become lovers of their brethren,
are humble men.
To these condescending to others is not so hard as it is to other men,
who still remain unmortified, unsanctified;
the last are not fit for the service of the church of Christ,
nor are any fit for it but such as are endowed with that wisdom which is from above,
because that only makes first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be entreated,
full of mercy, and full of good fruits, without partiality and without hypocrisy;
that this wisdom may be often asked for,
and liberally given to my friends in +++________+++ is my sincere desire.

LETTER LXIV.

11th month 7th, 1800.

Esteemed Friend,

The ingenious manner in which I found the hints I
lately ventured to give thee were received,
induces me to throw before thee some thoughts which have at times
struck me respecting the dangers that await ministers in our society,
more especially the young, and shall I add, those of thy sex.
I think it possible, at least,
in the first place that an honest and grateful desire to bear testimony
to the Lord`'s goodness in his tender and fatherly dealings with
his poor children in this state of probation,
may carry some forward into an office unto which,
in its more solemn and important services, they were never called or qualified;
and this is more peculiarly likely,
when a fresh sense of mercies received may raise this language in the soul,
"`what shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits?
Surely I will take the cup of salvation, graciously handed me,
and call upon the name of the Lord.`"
Having thus stepped forward on motives of gratitude and obedience;
the fear of looking back after putting our hand to the plough,
may rather tend to push forward, while tenderness in the minds of some friends,
and want of judgment in others, may have precluded all plain dealing,
and the wholesome advice of true eldership.
Thus, where only a little incense from "`the fields of offering,`"
when the dews of Hermon have refreshed the breathing plants,
might be looked for, the works of an apostle may be attempted, and the result is evident.
The sacred cause is not promoted, nay worse, it is injured,
and those who love it above all things, are wounded:
wounded too in the house of their friends, where wounds are most deeply felt.
To those also who may have been rightly called,
there is great need of suspecting the possibility of deception,
especially if of sanguine temperament,
and the mind apt to take lofty excursions in the dangerous regions of imagination.
There is a judicious remark of some unknown writer on this head, of which I took a copy,
and it is at thy service-- "`There is no faculty of the
soul more exposed to the attacks of our ever active enemy,
at least more liable to be injured by them than the imagination;
its nature is so restless and ungovernable,
that the utmost vigilance of a well regulated mind,
and the assiduous use of all the weapons of our warfare,
are scarcely sufficient for keeping it in that degree of subordination,
which is necessary for repelling the enemy`'s assaults.
And when, in addition to this disadvantage, the mind is much unfurnished with knowledge,
the judgment weak, and the temper sanguine,
it is no wonder that the father of lies should rule in the imagination.`"
But by all this I am not desiring to discourage what is right,
and am fully persuaded that there is a way yet cast up, wherein the wayfaring man,
though a fool to the wisdom of this world, shall not err; and that if the eye be single,
and the heart attentive to the simple path of duty,
the whole body will be filled with light sufficient for the duties required.
What I wish to enforce is, that in teachers, as fully (if not more so) as in hearers,
great watchfulness, care, and fear, with great simplicity of soul, are required;
and let me add, all obscure expressions and allusions to scripture passages,
familiar chiefly to religious people, should be avoided when addressing others,
or even a mixed multitude.

I have feared that many have heard scripture doctrines
so expressed as not to know it was such,
but apprehended it was some peculiar notions of our own.
It were better in such cases to refer to the sacred writer, whether prophet or apostle;
to say we do not know which to refer to,
savours of idleness in those who minister at the altar,
and who may reasonably be expected to know how to
handle the tools appointed for their use,
and to execute the business before them as those that must give an account.
With nothing but good-will to the best and most glorious cause do I thus write:
I hope thou wilt not misconceive me,
for truly do I desire that Zion`'s light may go forth as brightness,
and her salvation as a lamp that burneth;
that the beneficial light thus handed to the weary traveller,
may lead him safely on his journey, and to the city of the great king.

I am thy real Friend,

R+++.+++ G.

LETTER LXV.

Brentford, 6th month 11th, 1770.

Dear Friend,

My earnest desire for thy welfare will hardly suffer me to rest,
because of thy imminent danger.
I consider thee as one mercifully favoured with another divine visitation:
that thou mayst reap the advantage of it is my concern,
but that thou art in the way to lose it is my greatest fear;
as I purpose to satisfy thy mind the right way, and not offend thee,
I shall endeavour to give thee sufficient reasons why I thus write.
When it pleaseth God in his great mercy first to favour our minds in a particular manner,
it is expected, and justly, because really necessary,
that our minds should be steadily and strongly turned
to that good with which we are so visited:
consequently turned inwards, much inwards, and again as much from all other things,
not only from things without, which as it were press upon or into our notice,
but also from the workings of our own mind about
such things as may be naturally agreeable to us,
from the cast or natural turn of our minds, or the present state we may be in.
Now as we have been thus graciously regarded by the best of all beings,
to bring us to embrace that which is undeniably good, and to redeem us from all evil,
in order to our happiness, so we have a dreadful enemy who is ever endeavouring our ruin,
by drawing our minds from good and so into evil; of this evil spirit we have, I presume,
had proper notice in holy writ.
Now as this apollyon or destroyer is not allowed
in our present probationary state to act by force,
his way of working our destruction is by subtlety.
Of this we have had forewarning in the account given us
of his deceiving her who was the mother of all living;
and his subtlety is so great, that John in the Revelation tells us,
"`He deceived the whole world.`"

Has my friend thought enough of these things as warnings to us?
I say as warnings to us.
Is my friend brought to be enough on his guard against this mighty enemy of ours?
An adversary who, when poor man in his fallen state is visited,
that he might obtain a higher and happier station,
is ever endeavouring to keep him down in sin and misery,
and from rising into the redeemed state.
And when by joining in with divine visitations,
men are raised and stationed to be as the stars of heaven,
(but not fixed ones) how alarming is our enemy described,
and represented to us as a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns,
and seven crowns upon his heads, and as drawing such down from heaven,
and casting them to the earth again, and this by his tail,
when perhaps he was thought gone by, by such.
He may make it his business to busy us about the final lot of men,
in the matter hinted in the last page of the pamphlet thou desired my opinion of:
and this certainly suits his purpose better than our attending
to that power that would bruise his head,
and bring him shortly under our feet.
I am sure my friend will allow me to ask a few questions; and first,
What good can it do to weaken the awful sanctions of religion?
In the second place, who, besides this deceiver,
will undertake to remove the great gulf which God has so fixed,
that there is no passing from state to state? Luke 16:26.


"`I pray thee therefore, Father, that thou wouldst send him to my father`'s house,
for I have five brethren, that he may testify unto them,
lest they also come into this place of torment.`"
Verse 27 and 28. Upon which I observe this last request on behalf of his brethren,
seems manifestly grounded on all hopes for himself being cut off;
and if his request had been granted,
I am persuaded that the fixedness of this great gulf would not have been forgotten,
but have been testified of to his brethren.

"`Thou shalt not be punished eternally for thy sins`" here:
"`Ye shall not surely die,`" manifestly was and is designed
to lessen our dread of breaking the divine command,
and therefore by whom we may easily judge.
As I believe the scriptures that say, "`No man knoweth the Father but the Son,
and he to whom the Son revealeth him,`" thou wilt I trust approve
my preferring the knowledge of God through Jesus Christ,
before any ideas that I can merely as a man form of him.
I have thought sometimes that the perfect purity of the divine Being,
and his knowing "`who are his,`" is our security
in point of happiness on observance of his law:
and on this bottom it is,
that the righteous have reason to "`rejoice at the remembrance of his holiness.`"
Take away the holiness of the divine Being, and all our security for happiness is lost:
for upon that supposition, he might say one thing to us, and do another by us.
We must then in the first place, for our own security,
establish the perfect purity of the divine Being;
and must not his love of that which is good, and hatred of that which is evil,
infinitely exceed ours?
Shall we then measure his rewards and punishments by our little love of good, and I fear,
greatly fear, too little hatred of evil,
and especially of that evil to which we may be most inclined;
and here I cannot but endeavour to lay open the old and still grand deceiver.
I have often thought men magnify the mercy of God in the wrong place,
(if I may so express myself) for can any thing be a plainer snare of the enemy of man
than to set him to magnify the mercy of God in some future portion of eternity.
Thinking of his mercy to be extended then, naturally lessens our fear now;
and this is obtaining a point the enemy has ever aimed at,
and how much and how often he works this way, few men have well considered.

But there is mercy with the Lord now, that he may be feared, that is,
he still has mercy on us, that we may learn to fear him.
Thinking of his mercy now, is good, because it has a good effect upon us;
when the serpent began to tempt Eve,
it is observable his first attempt was to lessen
her fear of breaking the command of God to her.
As I am principally concerned to put thee very strictly
on thy guard against thy enemy and mine,
I must say he will, I know he will,
use every infernal endeavour to keep thee from a close attention
of soul to the quickening spirit which has visited us,
to redeem and quicken out of the fall; mind, my beloved friend, oh, mind, I beseech thee,
this quickening redeeming spirit.
I am sure, (though in common I do not love to be positive) yet, in this point,
I must say I am sure thy everlasting happiness depends upon it;
and this thy adversary knows, and will, if possible, prevent,
by drawing away thy attention from the Lord`'s good spirit,
which thou hast at times felt, and known also what he has appeared inwardly for.

Now in the course of what I have had to say to my friend,
being brought to speak of the quickening spirit, if I am not greatly mistaken,
here we are brought to the very foundation of religion, in point of experience; for,
according to the best authority, "`the spirit of truth is to be our guide,
into all truth;`" and as I am fully convinced in my own mind,
that religion cannot be understood but by experience,
so it seems proper for all who read of the spirit of truth in the holy scriptures,
rightly to consider what they do feel or experience in their own
hearts of those operations of the holy spirit described therein.
I must not stay now to enumerate these descriptions; but say here every man is,
in the first place,
referred to his own feelings of the principle we
profess--then reason comes in its proper place,
and loudly and strongly pronounces,
as surely as the mind of man is favoured with so excellent a principle,
"`it must be minded, it must be kept to,
it must in religious things be preferred to every thing.`"
And he that is firmly brought to believe in this divine principle of truth,
and properly to regard it,
is brought to practise what long ago was a truth delivered to the world,
"`He that believeth maketh not haste;`" and I may add,
but waits for his guide in whom he has believed,
being properly apprehensive of the danger of going without him.
This keeps a man much at home, and to the great business of inward deep experience,
and makes him cautious, exceedingly cautious, of rambling abroad into speculations,
where there are labyrinths, which must perplex,
and in which it is easy for the human mind, without the divine guide, to be lost,
utterly lost.

LETTER LXVI.

Warrington, 20th 1st. month 1752.

Dear Friend,

I Doubt not but the same conveyance that brings this
will bring some account of thy dear and worthy father,
whom I saw at Liverpool on his way to Ireland, a few weeks ago, in pretty good health,
and alive and cheerful in his labour in which he has been closely concerned,
and I hope to good service in divers respects; doubtless to his own great peace,
and uniting him in heart to the faithful.

In the freedom we had to each other,
he imparted to me one or two of thy affectionate letters to him,
which seemed to breathe strongly of the language of tender affection to him,
and an awful regard to the heavenly Father;
and has been the means of thy being often in my very near remembrance,
and some desire attended,
to send thee the salutation of true love in Christ Jesus our holy Head,
in whom stands the fellowship of the family the world over.
Great has been thy advantage, dear friend, in being descended from worthy parents, who,
by example and precept, have sought thy nurture and growth in the things of God;
the visitation of heavenly light and life has also been extended,
and I hope in a great and good degree embraced, and has pointed out the means of help,
or the terms of happiness, and inclined thy heart to seek it.

Many are the besetments and probations of a mind
awakened to seek an inheritance among the blessed,
and of various kinds they are; but the mighty arm is revealed and made bare,
for all those that refuse to be comforted without it.
Many are the low places the righteous tread,
and in the line of their experience deep answers deep;
some are brought upon us through our inadvertency and negligence;
let us then enquire the cause and remove it;
sometimes the heavens are made like brass to us, to teach us how to want,
and like winter seasons, to strengthen our roots, that we grow not top heavy,
but in all things our heavenly Father deals with us tenderly, and for our good.

Let therefore thy attention be steady to him for counsel and guidance,
and he will not forsake thee in the time of thy secret bewailings,
but spread a table for thee in the desert.
Oh! that our youth might thus awfully bow under the operation of the Lord`'s hand,
that their minds might be subject to him whose we are,
and whom we ought to serve in the spirit of our minds.
I feel in my mind the sympathy of the blessed covenant,
and the spreading of the Father`'s wing theewards,
and crave of the Almighty one to have thee in his keeping,
and of thee never to forfeit it by any means.
He is all sufficient to abide with thee continually.
He is often with his people when they perceive it not: he dwells in thick darkness often,
and was as certainly the mighty help of Israel,
when they groaned in anguish in the land of Egypt,
as when the glory of the Lord filled the temple at the feast of dedication.
I commend thee to him, seek him diligently, serve him honestly,
and follow on to know his requirings, with full purpose of heart to be faithful thereto;
and no weapon formed against thee will prosper,
nor any place be allotted so low in which the omnipotent arm will not sustain.

My dear love attends thy mother and thyself, though personally unknown.
I salute thee with gospel affection; and remain,

Thy faithful friend,

Samuel Fothergill.

LETTER LXVII.

Shipton, 1762.

Dear Cousin,

It is now several years since the correspondence between thee and me was dropped,
but notwithstanding that, I have often thought of thee, particularly of late;
I think few days have gone over my head, but I have had thee in remembrance;
many and various are the scenes I have passed through since I wrote last to thee;
and though I am but young in years, I have met with a great deal of trouble,
part of which I confess is of my own bringing on,
a consideration tending rather to aggravate than alleviate them.
I have been near six years married to a young man with whom
I contracted an acquaintance when I was but a girl;
but knowing how disagreeable the match would be to my father,
I durst not consent to it in his life-time, but engaged myself to marry him,
if I survived my father, who was suddenly removed from us by death;
soon after the affair got out, and reached the knowledge of Friends,
who took unwearied pains to prevent it; and laboured with me in much love to desist,
and refrain his company, but all to no purpose.
I cannot express, though I believe I shall never forget the conflicts I had,
between known duty and a foolish inclination; the last prevailed,
and I fled from the faces of my best friends (I thought them so
even then) to rid myself of their kind well-meant importunities.
I was greatly dissatisfied with the step I took even at the time I was taking it,
and after my marriage, was for three years in a kind of gloomy lethargic disposition,
though I regretted my unhappy state, and the cause of it;
but afterwards growing more and more uneasy under it,
I became desirous of making public confession of my error,
and begged to be reconciled to my friends,
for whom I had all along entertained a loving regard;
accordingly I wrote a paper in much sincerity of heart,
and I hope some degree of repentance, to the monthly meeting,
desiring and hoping it might have been accepted without my personal appearance;
but friends thinking that necessary,
two months after the monthly meeting I had notice of it given me,
and that Friends expected me there.
I went into the mens`' meeting, I may truly say, in much awe, fear, and trembling;
the paper being read, questions agreeable and necessary to the occasion were asked me,
by which I was too much affected to return any other
but broken and almost unintelligible answers.
Friends compassioned my case, and in much love and charity granted my petition,
since which time I have been favoured with their tender care, regard, and notice;
and though I cannot get to meetings so often as I could wish,
yet my husband has no aversion to friends, but is not willing I should go,
when I am likely to be wanted at home,
which on week-days especially is frequently the case, as we keep a little shop,
and my husband often works at his trade;
and notwithstanding my heart in some respects is more at ease than before,
yet I have still many difficulties to encounter.
I have three children living, the eldest a fine girl,
who was taken from us before she could go alone,
and has continued ever since at my husband`'s mother`'s,
who was unwilling to part with the child,
and the poor little creature is already often distressed
to know how to behave betwixt us.
She would go to meeting with me, and use the plain language, but tells me,
dares not for fear of offending her grandmother, of whom the child is very fond.
I long to have her at home,
but my husband will not so much as allow me to hint my desire to his mother; yet I hope,
if I live, to gain that point.
My little boy and girl at home, if I do not live to see them brought up,
or probably if I do, may fall into improper hands, and under the tuition of people,
who for want of a proper care over them, may expose them to temptations and difficulties,
which they might have been exempt from, had mine been a more prudent choice.

And now dear cousin, I have in some degree informed thee how things have been with me,
though I am pretty much a stranger to the particulars of thy situation.
I heard some time ago, that thou enjoyed but poor health,
and was under great depression of spirits, a state I have been little tried with,
though many who have not been so faulty as I have,
many good and worthy people have known it; I believe it is a painful trying time,
and though Providence is all-sufficient, yet the company and regard of good friends,
may be of great service,
the means of pouring the balm of comfort and consolation into an afflicted humbled heart.
It is far from my design to give any offence, or take upon me to advise,
knowing myself a very improper person so to do,
neither do I value myself upon my own recommendation with Friends:
every time I think of it, though it is a comfort to me,
it rather serves to humble than exalt me, in my own opinion.
I shall be very glad of a line or two from thee when it is convenient,
and should be pleased if thou would write to me with
the same freedom and confidence I have used to thee,
and should rejoice to hear thou wert perfectly reconciled
and reunited to thy friends and parents,
and that thy worthy father and mother might yet live to have comfort in thee,
and thou in them.
My good wishes attend thy husband and children.

From thy affectionate kinswoman,

Elizabeth Dale.

LETTER LXVIII.

Richard Shackleton to E. D.

Ballitore, 10th month 1762.

Dear Cousin,

I Perused thy letter to my sister Rayton, and a secret sympathy,
strengthened by the affection of natural relation,
induces me to commence a correspondence with thee.
I have lamented, dear cousin, that a person blest with a good natural understanding,
improved by a good education, descended from religious ancestors,
who were honoured with bearing a testimony to, and suffering for the cause of truth;
and who was doubtless as it were by birthright,
made sensible of the essence of true religion: I say,
I have lamented that such a one as thou should,
through the subtlety of the serpent that beguiled Eve,
have been instrumental through the strong influence of thy example,
to lay waste our Christian testimony relative to mixed marriages;
and which is a consideration still more grievous, long observation has proved this truth,
that few who have been overtaken in this great fault,
though favoured with the gift of sincere repentance, and it is hoped,
accepted in themselves, have ever after been of much service in the Society.

They have walked mournfully on their way,
through a path of inward and outward affliction,
and have been made as living monuments for others to take warning at, and beware;
thus thou knows, I believe, dear cousin, it has been with divers,
and the opinion I have of thy good sense makes me not fear
to give offence by this plain manner of writing,
at the same time that my sincere regard for thy welfare and happy restoration,
makes me willing to drop any hint, which improved by thy own reflection,
etc. may contribute in any little degree to that desirable end: but neither, dear cousin,
would I discourage thee in the least from that good resolution
which thou seems to have happily taken up,
of returning like the prodigal son to the Father`'s house.

I mention the evil of thy transgression,
not because I believe thee insensible of it thyself,
nor that I would increase the affliction of the afflicted, and add grief to thy sorrow;
but as this offence has long appeared to me, to be of a grievous and complicated nature,
a stain, though not of the deepest dye, as some gross pollutions,
yet not easily worn out, thou may with more humble prostration,
with more deep contrition of spirit, and with more steady attention of mind seek to him,
whose law thou hast transgressed, and taught others so to do, by the most cogent precept,
thy own example.
And if this, dear cousin, be thy constant, uniform, inward travail, and exercise,
to witness from day to day this baptism which alone can wash and make clean,
though thy transgression has been of a nature which I think
I have repeatedly felt to be displeasing to the Almighty,
yet I hope by this means not only as thou very sensibly writes,
thou mayest be outwardly reinstated in the union of Our society, but will in his time,
perhaps in the deeps of trouble, witness that secret union and reconciliation with him,
which will be thy present support to bear up thy drooping head,
and be the joyful earnest and assurance of a rest in that kingdom where the evil one,
and his agents, cease from troubling, which in sincere affection is my desire for thee.

Our family`'s love, etc.

Richard Shackleton.

LETTER LXIX.

E+++.+++ D. in answer to the foregoing.

Shipton, 2nd month 1763.

Dear Cousin,

Thy very acceptable letter came safe to hand.
I cannot fully express how much I think myself obliged
to thee for thy tender regard to a poor creature,
sunk in my own opinion below thy notice;
it was obliging condescension in thee to propose commencing a correspondence with me,
and will always be gratefully remembered.
Sorry indeed should I have been,
if thou had entertained a thought that I should have
been displeased with any part of thy letter;
those parts which strike most home to the course of my thoughts,
I mean my own misconduct, were not unwelcome,
and by painful experience can I witness to the truth of thy just remarks.
To walk in a path of inward, as well as outward affliction, has long been my lot,
nor have I any expectation of much alteration for the better in this life,
bereft at times, even of the flatterer, hope;
my inward situation is perfectly unknown to any person;
I am obliged to appear serene when my poor heart is torn with conflicting passions;
I have not a sufficient foundation to support myself under my daily trials,
and my attention is too much taken up, and engrossed with the cares of the world.
I seldom go to meeting, my husband being unwilling any business, though ever so trivial,
should be neglected on that account.
I have involved my poor children too in many troubles and perplexities;
may the Lord have mercy and compassion on them, who are innocent of my transgression,
and direct their feet in the right path, that I have missed and turned aside from,
which has cost me my peace of mind.
Thou art a father of children, daughters too;
it is my sincere desire they may be preserved from falling into like errors,
and take warning by me,
who have not had I believe one hour`'s solid satisfaction since I married.
I once thought no person on earth capable of drawing me so far aside;
secure and confident in my own imaginary strength,
I dared at first to dally with the temptation, and was convinced, by sad experience,
that the most trifling digression from our known duty,
is a very great advance to the contrary; I take notice of thy observation,
that few who have been guilty of my error, are ever after of much service to the Society.
It is not likely they should, the very nature of the offence,
and consequence attending it, exclude from a moral possibility of it:
and what right have we to expect miracles to be wrought
in favour of the disobedient who have knowingly acted so,
and have neither ignorance nor a negligent education to plead for excuse.

Dear cousin, in perusing what I have written,
I cannot but think it may appear a little particular,
that I should use such freedom in my first letter to a person I have never seen;
but I am encouraged,
and as it were called upon to an almost unlimited frankness by thine,
which shews thee to be a sincerely well-wishing and sympathizing friend,
and in some measure sensible of my condition.
Permit me to request the continuance of thy tender regard for me.
My husband, children, and self, are mercifully favoured with good health,
though it is a sickly time here with many.
William Longman, of Leeds, died lately, his death was in last week`'s paper,
which was the first account we had of it.
My dear love attends thee, thy wife, and children, from

Thy affectionate kinswoman,

Elizabeth Dale.

LETTER LXX.

Dear Friend,

My dear and tender love salutes thee, in that love from whence I had my being,
and from whence sprang all my Father`'s children, who are born from above,
heirs of an everlasting inheritance.
Oh! how sweet and pleasant are the pastures which
my Father causeth all his sheep to feed in;
there is variety of plenty in his pastures, milk for babes,
and strong meat for them of riper age, and wine to refresh those that are ready to faint,
even the wine of the kingdom, that makes glad the heart, when it is ready to faint,
by reason of the infirmities.
Sure I am, none can be so weary, but he takes care of them; nor none so nigh fainting,
but he puts his arm under their heads;
nor none can be so beset with enemies on every side, but he will arise and scatter;
nor none so heavy laden and big with young, but he takes notice of them,
and gently leads them, and will not leave them behind unto the merciless wolf,
because they are his own, and his life is the price of their redemption,
and his blood of their ransom; and if they be so young that they cannot go,
he carries them in his arms; and when they can feel nothing stirring after him,
his bowels yearn after them; so tender is this good shepherd after his flock.
I can tell, for I was as one that once went astray,
and wandered upon the barren mountains; and when I had wearied myself with wandering,
I went into the wilderness, and there I was torn as with briars,
and pricked as with thorns, sometimes thinking this was the way,
and sometimes concluding that was the way,
and by and by concluding all was out of the way; and then bitter mourning came upon me,
and weeping for want of the interpreter; for when I sought to know what was the matter,
and where I was, it was too hard for me.
Then I thought I would venture on some way where it was most likely to find a lost God,
and I would pray with them that prayed, and fast with them that fasted,
and mourn with them that mourned, if by any means I might come to rest, but found it not,
until I came to see the candle lighted in my own house,
and my heart swept from those thoughts and imaginations, and willings, and runnings,
and to die unto them all, not heeding of them, but watching against them,
lest I should let my mind go a whoring after them.
And here I dwelt for a time as in a desolate land uninhabited,
where I sat alone as a sparrow upon the house-top,
and was hunted up and down like a partridge upon the mountains, and could rest nowhere,
but some lust or thought or other followed me at the heels,
and disquieted me night and day, until I came to know him in whom was rest,
and no occasion of stumbling, in whom the devil hath no part,
and he became unto me as a hiding-place from the storms, and from the tempests.
Then came my eyes to see my Saviour, and my sorrow fled away,
and he became made unto me all in all, my wisdom, my righteousness,
and my sanctification; in whom I was and am complete,
to the praise of the riches of his grace and goodness, that endures for ever.

Therefore be not discouraged, O thou tossed as with tempests! nor dismayed in thyself;
because thou seest such mighty hosts of enemies rising up against thee,
and besetting thee on every side: for none was so beset and tried, and tempted,
as the true seed was, who was a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.
But be thou still in thy mind, and let the billows pass over, and wave upon wave;
and fret not thyself because of them, neither be cast down,
as if it should never be otherwise with thee; sorrow comes at night,
but joy in the morning: and the days of thy mourning shall be over,
and the accuser will God cast out for ever.
For therefore was I afflict ed, and not comforted, and tempted, and tried, for this end,
that I might know how to speak a word in due season,
unto those who are tempted and afflicted as I once was;
as it was said unto me in that day when sorrow lay heavy upon me.

Therefore be not disconsolate,
neither give heed unto the reasonings and disputings of thy own heart;
nor the fears that rise therefrom, but be strong in the faith,
believing in the light which lets thee see them,
and his grace thou wilt know to be sufficient for thee,
and his strength to be made perfect in thy weakness.
And so wilt thou rather glory in thy infirmities, that his power may rest upon thee,
than in thy earnest desires to be rid of them;
for by these things thou wilt come to live in the life of God, and joy in God,
and glory in tribulation, when thou hast learned in all conditions to be contented:
and through trials, and deep exercises, is the way to learn this lesson.
These things in dear love to thee I have written,
being somewhat sensible of thy condition, and the many snares thou art daily liable unto;
therefore watch that thou fall not into temptation,
and my God and Father keep thee in the arms of eternal love, over all, unto the end,
unto his praise.
Amen.

John Crooke.

LETTER LXXI.

Samuel Fothergill to the Monthly Meeting he belonged to.

Dear Friends,

It hath for some time lain heavy upon me to write a few lines to you,
upon the following account.
The Lord in his everlasting kindness (that long strove with my soul) hath
been pleased to unstop my deaf ears that I might hear him,
the Shepherd of his flock,
and to open my blind eyes and let me see my state as it really was,
very desperate and lamentable.
He hath shewn me the dreadful precipice I was on the brink of,
and hath breathed into me the breath of life,
in order that I might arise from the dead and live;
he has set my sins in order before me, and shewn how far I had estranged myself from him,
and raised strong desires in me to return to him, the Redeemer of my soul.
The consideration of his kindness has raised in my
soul a just abhorrence of my former practices,
which induces me to make this public declaration of them in a few words;
I know my sins are so many and obvious that it is impossible
and needless to recount and remark upon them,
for I was then in the bond of iniquity,
though it has pleased the Father of mercies to bring
me since into the very gall of bitterness,
and into anxiety of soul inexpressible, yea,
not to be apprehended by any but those who have trod the same path,
and drank of the same cup; yet, blessed be the name of God,
he that hath kindled breathings in my soul after him, would sometimes break in upon me,
and though the waves of Jordan have gone over my head, his supporting arm was underneath,
that I should not be discouraged.
He in his infinite love has given me to understand,
that the things which belong to my peace are not utterly hid from my eyes;
that though I had drank up iniquity as the ox drinketh up water;
although I had exceeded others in sin, and long done despite to him,
yet there was mercy with him that he might be feared.

Now would I address myself to the youth amongst you,
and in a certain sense of the divine extendings of that love wherewith he hath loved us,
do I salute you with sincere desires, that that God which visited our fathers,
while aliens and strangers to him, may be our God;
that we may embrace the day of our visitation,
and not turn our backs on so great a mercy as he, I am sensible, is daily extending.
Oh!
I have tasted of his love, I have had to celebrate his name,
and though unfit for the work, I cannot be easy, or discharge my known duty,
without calling upon you to forsake the vanities of the world,
for the end thereof is unavoidable sorrow and endless torment: but happy are they who,
by a timely application, are earnestly seeking the Lord,
who will (I speak by blessed experience) be found
of those who early and diligently seek him;
for he has appeared to me when I was afraid I was forgotten, as a morning without clouds,
to my exceeding great encouragement and consolation,
and strengthened me in my resolutions to follow him who has done so much for my soul.
Bear with me yet a little, for I write not my own words;
that blessed Saviour has lain it upon me, who is willing that all should be saved,
and come to him; let him, I intreat you, have his perfect work in you; he will wash you,
or else you can have no share in him; I can truly say,
that during the time of my first conviction, my lips quivered, and my belly trembled,
that my soul might have rest in the day of trouble.
I choose not to write this, but I cannot be easy,
unless I call others to the like enjoyment;
in bowels of tender love I again salute and take my leave of you, with strong desires,
that you who are advanced in years, and favoured with the Lord`'s goodness,
may remember me when it is well with you, that I may be preserved,
though beset with temptations on every hand.
The Lord in mercy be with you, saith my soul.
Farewell.

Samuel Fothergill.

LETTER LXXIJ.

Anthony Benezet to John Pemberton, (then in England) written a little before his death.

Philadelphia, 5th month 29th, 1783.

It is amazing what an influence the love of the world, its esteem and friendships,
and the desire of amassing wealth, living (themselves and children) in delicacy and shew,
in conformity to the world, has upon so many in our society, who in other respects,
appear under some impressions of good;
notwithstanding they cannot but be sensible of its woeful
effect upon the religious welfare of their offspring,
who thereby (as mentioned by the apostle) fall into snares and hurtful lusts,
often to their perdition; notwithstanding the nature of our profession,
and a conformity to the example and precepts of our Lord,
lay such an absolute prohibition on such a state:
"`Lay not up treasures for yourselves on earth,`" says our blessed Saviour;
"`How hardly shall those who have riches enter,`" etc.
"`Woe to you that are rich.`"--Be not conformed but be ye transformed,
that ye may be the belter qualified to follow him who has called
you in the way of the cross to be soldiers in his holy warfare,
but learn of him who was meek and low; who, though he was Lord of all,
chose to come in the form of a servant, walked on foot, fed on barley loaves, etc.
Some injunctions more doubtful and less likely to affect the heart,
we take according to the full force of the expressions, as with respect to an oath,
whilst others whose hurtful nature is more apparent,
and as positively prohibited by our Saviour, as that of laying up treasures,
we make nothing of, to that degree that even acknowledged ministers,
persons favoured with excellent gifts,
have so much degraded their noble calling as to engage
in entangling and dangerous worldly affairs,
or in seeking rich wives, sometimes in other respects unsuitable for them;
which is a stumbling block to sober enquirers,
who feel the strength of the gospel injunction, not to love the world,
nor seek high things, but trust in God.
When they see those of note amongst Quakers thus labour to lay up wealth in abundance,
though they cannot but see its direful effects on their offspring,
who are thereby induced to fly above truth, and even disregard their parents.
Well, I trust, the woe attending this disposition, as well to the individuals,
as to the reputation of truth, and hindrance of its prevalence amongst the people,
will become so apparent that endeavours will be used in a society capacity,
to put a check upon this disposition which is so much for laying heap upon heap,
land to land, etc. by requiring of their members,
that when they have got a sufficiency to carry on their respective business,
they shall not suffer wealth to heap up in their hands,
but shall apply the overplus to the relief of the necessitous, and other good works,
which the industry and frugality, which our principles lead to, will naturally produce.

An instance, which not long since occurred,
caused me to make some painful reflections upon this most weighty subject,
which I find my mind inclined to communicate to thee, my dear friend;
perhaps thou mayst make a profitable use of it in some places where thy lot may be cast.
A friend died,
reputed to have left 60 to 70,000 £ to a number of children and grandchildren,
already so elevated by the fortunes they were possessed of,
as to be ready to take wing and fly above truth, in conformity to the world,
its friendships, fashions, etc.
This happened in the depth of winter,
one of those intense cold days which we all have felt to be very trying,
even to those who are best provided with fuel, suitable clothing, etc.
As I passed along, I observed aged people, and other weakly persons,
tottering about the streets, or standing in the cold,
in pursuit of a few pence towards a scanty subsistence,
many of those doubtless poorly provided with fuel or bedding,
both of which articles were then exceeding scarce and dear.
I compared the situation and necessity of these aged people,
with the superfluous wealth and delicate living of
the children of the rich man lately deceased,
and could not but be astonished at the selfishness and caprice of the human heart.
I queried with myself, are both these children of the same Father,
equally under his notice?
Are they enjoined (and do they profess) to love each other as they love themselves?
Why is not at least three quarters of the wealth of a number
of the rich Quakers laid out in procuring a place of refuge,
comfort, and moderate provision for such weak and aged people, that they may,
in the decline of life, be put into the most suitable situation,
to think and prepare for their latter end, and enjoy a moderate state of comfort?
Is it honest to God or man?
Is it doing justly as stewards of the wealth committed to our care?
la it loving our neighbour as ourselves?
If mankind are indeed brethren,
can it be agreeable to the good Father of the family of mankind,
that one should engross so much, and employ it to feed the corruptions of his offspring,
whilst others are under such manifest disadvantages for want of the necessaries of life?
Many such strange inconsistencies thou wilt meet with, in which, I trust,
thou wilt be led to act in truth without partiality,
and to enforce the doctrine of the rich man and Lazarus.
