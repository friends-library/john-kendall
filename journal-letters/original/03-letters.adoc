=== The Author to the Reader

The Letters which follow were written, on various occasions,
to my friends and acquaintance, without any view of making them public:
yet I would not withhold what might have a tendency, though in a small degree,
to encourage a disposition to religious and virtuous conduct.
What I have written in this, or any other way,
I leave as a testimony to the truth and power of the religion of my Lord and Saviour,
Jesus Christ, in which I am confirmed by the experience of many years,
and can recommend it as the blessing of Societies and Families.
